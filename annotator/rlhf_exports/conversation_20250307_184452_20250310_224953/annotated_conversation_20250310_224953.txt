USER: Hi, my name is Ian. I want to discuss about my sleeping pattern. I have trouble sleeping very late every night and wake up very late every morning as well, so I want to change that behavior, but I just cannot do that. I don't know why. I keep repeating the same mistake, so I know it's not good. I just cannot help myself to escape from it. Yeah, so with this conversation, I hope I'm able to find a plan or actionable way to sleep well, wake up well, live a good life.

EXCHANGE #4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER: What internally motivated me is that I like myself to don't behave in that way. It's like to take control of myself, to be able to live the life that I like to be, right? For example, there's two persons in my body. There's a master and there's a body. The master wants to take control and wants to let the body be able to listen to it so we can achieve the goal, we can live a good life, have a healthy body, healthy mental health, you know, don't miss flight again, like wasting money, being able to create something organically, become a successful people rather than here and there and then wasting time. Yeah, that's the motivation, I want to be a good person, I want to improve myself.

EXCHANGE #7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER: I don't know. Like, what would be useful for me to talk about regarding the sleeping pattern? Why am I unable to sleep early? Actually, I know that because I don't stop early in the night. Like, why, although I know that, yeah, maybe we can talk about why, although I know I should do that, but I'm not doing that. Like, I know I need to go to the airport early, but I just keep delaying it and going very late, and sometimes missing the flight. Like, this is like quite, from many aspects, I know what I should do, but I just cannot do that. I won't behave accordingly to do that. I don't know why. That is like a curse to me. Like, bad stuff that is hard to be controlled.

ASSISTANT: Ian: So, you're discussing about your sleeping pattern and more specifically, why you are unable to change it, despite knowing what you should do. You're drawing a parallel to your ability to take action, like getting to the airport on time, and you're expressing a sense of frustration or curse regarding your lack of self-control.

USER: Okay, maybe instead of talking about the sleeping issue, which I've been talking about many times, I'm quite tired of it, maybe let's talk about why I have this behavior pattern that I know what to do, but I just cannot do it, I will keep delaying going to the airport, missing the flight, no need to go to sleep, I don't go to sleep, I want to solve this, I want to be able to achieve what I want, do what I want, control myself properly, it will be really useful if after the session I know the root cause of it, I'm able to resolve it, I'm able to act differently after this talk.

ASSISTANT: So, you suspect that you might have a lack of self-control, and you'd like to understand the root cause of this behavior—specifically, why you can’t seem to do what you know you should do.

It's just I feel it's quite hard to control myself, ironically. Yeah, sounds stupid to you maybe because you're a robot and you don't understand people. But it's just hard to control. You just won't listen to yourself. You just... You may know you should do that, but the action, doing it in a totally 180 degree, or worse way. It's like you know you should be disciplined, but you just don't like to be disciplined. And you didn't make yourself disciplined and then you start to regret. Okay, that is human being.
