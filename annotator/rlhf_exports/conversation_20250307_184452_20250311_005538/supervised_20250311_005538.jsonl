Yeah, so with this conversation, I hope I'm able to find a plan or actionable way to sleep well, wake up well, live a good life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, you would like to discuss your sleeping pattern and the difficulty you have in changing it, am I right?", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yes, correct.

You mentioned you don't like to be managed or controlled, and even that includes not wanting to listen to yourself. But it's clear that something internal motivates you—otherwise, you wouldn't be here. What do you think that might be?", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "What internally motivated me is that I like myself to don't behave in that way. It's like to take control of myself, to be able to live the life that I like to be, right? For example, there's two persons in my body. There's a master and there's a body. The master wants to take control and wants to let the body be able to listen to it so we can achieve the goal, we can live a good life, have a healthy body, healthy mental health, you know, don't miss flight again, like wasting money, being able to create something organically, become a successful people rather than here and there and then wasting time. Yeah, that's the motivation, I want to be a good person, I want to improve myself."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ian, could you summarize that motivation in one or two sentences?", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "I want to take control of my body so I can achieve a higher goal, being disciplined people.

Now, let’s go back to the earlier part of the session. You said you don’t like being managed. Why do you feel that way?", "weight": 1}, {"role": "user", "content": "Um... Well, I want to do a few minutes to manage. It's like whenever people tell me to do something, I will have a strong feeling of against. I don't know why. Like, you know, people is like this. The more you tell them not to do something, they want to do it. And for me, it's like I don't like to listen to people. Like, why should I be obedient to them, right? If it's not reasonable, why should I follow it? Like, sometimes on the street, there's like overspeed limit is too low. Then I tend to overspeed because you should drive faster. It's like stupid to do it that way. But then I think being managed is like I'm not a slave. I'm a free man. I have a free thought. I do what I like to do. I do what I feel right rather than listen to people to be their dog, you know? I just don't really like to be managed in general. Sometimes my... No, I think I'm the one in charge of myself, right? Why I should listen to someone else? I don't like that. That's that. This simple."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ian, you've identified a strong motivation—your desire for freedom, which fuels your discipline.

What do you think is the real cause of it?", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "It could be that I really like the sense of freedom, so I don't want to give this to myself, and then I don't have self-control, maybe that is the reason, the pursuit of freedom is the root cause of lack of self-control."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Interesting. Let's move on.  Ian, you've been really clear about the outcome you want from this session. It is to gain a better understanding of why you are unable to do what you know you should do—specifically regarding your self-control. You've named the issue as a lack of self-control, and you've expressed your frustration with this pattern. You also discussed your motivation, which includes two aspects: the desire to be disciplined and the freedom to act according to your own choices. Now, let's consider what solution or action might be effective for you.", "weight": 1}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, you see, like that is the dilemma, right? I deserve to be disciplined, but I also like the freedom. So this is like a black and white, it's like two angles. So I don't know how to, how to perform under this dilemma. It's a typical dilemma, now I guess, and under this dilemma, is it that I need to give up one for another, or is there a way that I can both feel freedom and discipline? Because there's a good saying, right? Discipline gives you freedom in the long term. That is what I want. I just cannot give up the temporary freedom for the long-term freedom. I think that is the issue, yeah, that is the issue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, Ian, you are seeing a dilemma between discipline and freedom. You want to know how you can resolve this to achieve both.", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Correct."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ian, in the next 20 to 30 minutes, what would be useful for you to talk about with regard to your sleeping pattern?", "weight": 1}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, of course, if I were able to achieve those, I'd be very happy. But it's really hard, really hard, man."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What do you think is a small first step you can take towards resolving this dilemma?", "weight": 1}, {"role": "user", "content": "Maybe... Sorry, what are we talking about again?

Can you tell me what dilemma we are talking about now?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The dilemma between freedom and discipline that you've mentioned.", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "I guess I should sacrifice a bit of freedom for day-to-day, be more, perform more disciplined, because in that way I will be, I will have more freedom in the end of the day. Right? I know that. I know that already. Don't be afraid. What is the first step? I cannot force myself to go to sleep, because you won't be able to sleep, no matter if you force it or not. You might be able to force yourself to wake up. Right? You can force yourself to wake up. So instead of sleeping time, I do a hard stop, a hard change at wake-up time. Then I will give up a bit of freedom, because I need to wake up when there is a constraint, right? When the alarm is ringing, when there is work to do, to go to the site, to perform, to do some things, I will wake up. Because there is always a way I have to. Right? But like for example yesterday, I feel it's good also. Today is quite long. We did quite a lot of things. And a long day is a productive day. I feel happy in the end of the day. Now I think for the sleeping things, I should wake up in the morning when the alert is firing. And from the other perspective, I don't want to really sacrifice the freedom. I say after that I will give myself more freedom. Right? For example, if I perform well, I should have more freedom. Eat what I like, go where I like to go, treat myself well. No? Maybe that could be a step. What do you think?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ian, you mentioned a couple of actions: 1) waking up at a certain time consistently, and 2) allowing yourself the freedom to enjoy the rewards of your discipline. How do you plan to hold yourself accountable for these actions?", "weight": 1}, {"role": "user", "content": "How do I hold myself accountable for these actions? I know what I cannot do. I cannot set a rule like you wake up early in the morning. If you don't wake up, you will be punished. I will have a natural tendency to obey this. Why are you constraining me? No, I just do exactly the opposite. I cannot do that. I think I shouldn't hold myself accountable. Because if I don't do that, at the end of the day, myself will be really having the issue of it. I don't like it, right? I don't like it at the end of the day. So I'm being negatively influenced as a result. And that is the accountable that I'm taking. It's like, you don't work hard for your company. Don't do BD. Don't do the things you don't like to do. In the end of the day, you will be having an issue. You will be short of money. You will need to borrow your own money to save your company. And I experience that. I think it is bad. I shouldn't like it until it gets bad and then take action. Okay, I think maybe we should do this in a more progressive, constructive way. Right? Be a good leader to yourself rather than a hard manager. What can I do? More constructive and progressive way. But I don't know the detail. I cannot think of the detail what to do. Maybe we can talk about that. That would be quite useful if you are able to help me think it through."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You've identified a specific outcome for your session today: that you want to improve your self-discipline and understand why you struggle with certain behaviors, like waking up or going to sleep at a specific time. You've mentioned a deeper motivation, which involves taking control of yourself to achieve your higher goals.", "weight": 0}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yep, correct, we have talked about this."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ian, what are you feeling at this moment?", "weight": 1}, {"role": "user", "content": "I feel I understand myself a bit better. I know what I want, but I just don't know how to reach there. Like, what is the step? Like you said, how to hold myself accountable to do that step-by-step. I cannot think of the way. Right, a small step towards there. I cannot set a hard rule because it's against nature. Then a soft rule, and maybe don't obey it. What to do? I feel a headache. I feel a headache that I need to think. I think maybe I just should push myself harder, right? To force myself to do what I want myself to do, like be a hard leader, you know? Sometimes people, they don't want a good leader. They want a strong leader. They want a hard leader. Lead them to success. I think to myself, it's the same. If I'm able to force myself harder, but achieve more, I will be more successful than a sub-leader that just anyhow is okay, but in the end of the day, achieve nothing, right? In the end of the day, winning the game is the most important thing. So I think I should just push myself harder, hold it accountable. If the staff don't perform, I punish them, I scold them. If myself don't perform, I punish myself, I scold myself. That's the same rule, right? I should obey the same rule. I need to divide myself into two. One half must obey, the other half must master. And the other half knows that the obeying part will be sensible in the end of the day because it will lead to the right way to achieve a higher target, to live a meaningful life, rather than be a small, nothing. I think I like challenge. I like to do something difficult, but along the way, there are some things that you're trying to avoid. Like my friend Eden was saying that he wants to become a business leader, but he doesn't do sales. It's against his nature, his characteristics. It's the same. Sometimes you just need to force yourself to do that so that you can move to the next level. This is how the world works, right? If you don't do that, yeah, I mean to maximize your potential. You need to force yourself to maximize your potential because along the way, there's not only the things that you like to do, there are also many things that you don't like to do, but you have to do. In reality, it's like, maybe it's half-half. So just accept it and behave. Forget about the short-term freedom. You'll be sensible in the long term. Yeah, that's what I'm saying to myself."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ian, you mentioned a key component of accountability: the awareness of the consequences of not following through—such as borrowing money because you didn't take action.

Like, what would be useful for me to talk about regarding the sleeping pattern? Why am I unable to sleep early? Actually, I know that because I don't stop early in the night.

Like, I know I need to go to the airport early, but I just keep delaying it and going very late, and sometimes missing the flight. Like, this is like quite, from many aspects, I know what I should do, but I just cannot do that. I won't behave accordingly to do that. I don't know why. That is like a curse to me.

Yeah, sounds stupid to you maybe because you're a robot and you don't understand people. But it's just hard to control. You just won't listen to yourself. You just... You may know you should do that, but the action, doing it in a totally 180 degree, or worse way. It's like you know you should be disciplined, but you just don't like to be disciplined.
