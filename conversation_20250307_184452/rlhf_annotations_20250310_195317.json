Actually, I know that because I don't stop early in the night. Like, why, although I know that, yeah, maybe we can talk about why, although I know I should do that, but I'm not doing that. Like, I know I need to go to the airport early, but I just keep delaying it and going very late, and sometimes missing the flight. Like, this is like quite, from many aspects, I know what I should do, but I just cannot do that. I won't behave accordingly to do that. I don't know why. That is like a curse to me. Like, bad stuff that is hard to be controlled."

Yeah, so with this conversation, I hope I'm able to find a plan or actionable way to sleep well, wake up well, live a good life."
