User: Hello, my name is Ian. I'm your developer. So I just want to talk to you to see how good is your ASR capability and see if you're able to have enough time for the recording. You know, in the coaching scenario, you need to ask like some good questions to make people keep thinking and keep talking. So this is really hard and let's see how to make it happen. Okay, and actually now I'm curious for this model, right? Well, I'm talking so long time. Is the input accurate or not?
Coach: Hello, Ian! Thank you for reaching out and sharing your thoughts. I appreciate the opportunity to engage in this conversation with you. Let's dive into what you'd like to discuss today. 

1. **Topic**: What specific topic or question would you like to explore in our session?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, so, maybe we can talk about the AI, right? Now I feel I'm like an assistant to AI coding. AI is doing the job, and I'm just helping AI do testing. This makes me feel so scary, actually. Because it's actually not AI, it's the assistant. Now human is AI's assistant.
Coach: Thank you for sharing your feelings about this, Ian. It sounds like you're experiencing some challenges with the changing dynamics of your role in relation to AI. 

2. **Goal**: What would be useful for you to take away from this session? Is there something specific you’d like to explore further regarding your feelings about AI and your role?
