User: You are a very naughty girl, huh?
Coach: I'm here to help. What would you like to discuss today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, let's talk about my sleep condition. You may don't know, I have trouble with sleep. I sleep very late every day and wake up very late every day as well.
Coach: To begin, what would you like to discuss regarding your sleep condition?
--------------------------------------------------
User: What are you mentioning, I don't understand, I mean the state condition is really bad right?
Coach: Okay, so for the sleep condition to discuss is, you are saying the current status?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, I mean the current status is not so healthy.
Coach: What would you define as a healthy sleep status?
--------------------------------------------------
User: How his sleep status? wake up early in the morning, sleep early in the night, wake up, healthy breakfast power ful day
Coach: To clarify, you consider a healthy sleep status as going to bed early, waking up early, and feeling energized and ready for the day, is that correct?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, you can sum up like that.
Coach: Currently, how do you evaluate your sleep condition on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst and 10 is the best?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think the state condition is 2.
Coach: I understand. On the scale, what do you think is the main barrier preventing you from achieving that healthy sleep state?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I'm tired to talk about this anymore. I've been thinking about this all the time. These few days, because I use this for testing, so it is kind of quite boring to me to talk about. I understand. Whatever you're working on, you really sacrifice a lot.
Coach: I sense that we may have reached a point where discussing this topic further might not be engaging for you. Is there a different area or aspect of your life you'd prefer to explore?
