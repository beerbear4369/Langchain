User: Hello, I'm Ian. How are you doing?
Coach: “Hi Ian, I’m doing well. It’s nice to see you.”
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, great!
Coach: So Ian, what would you like to talk about today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Maybe we can talk about my sleep condition. As you know, I have this sleep condition. I sleep very late and I also wake up quite late. This is not good for my health and I feel we should really improve on this. But every time, every night, I'm so fascinated about what I'm doing. I cannot stop. It's almost like every time until I cannot walk anymore. I feel really tired. I lay down and then I sleep on my sofa bed.
Coach: "So Ian, would you say the topic you want to discuss is about managing your sleep pattern?"
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, I think we can see so.
Coach: "Alright, and what specifically about your sleep pattern would you like to address?"
--------------------------------------------------
User: Specifically, I want to be able to change this pattern, not become wake up early and sleep early. You know, wake up early, exercise, meditation, and then have a productive day, and then go to bed before it's too late, and continue this good circle.
Coach: "So, if I understand correctly, you want to change your sleep pattern to wake up early and have a productive morning routine followed by an early bedtime?"
--------------------------------------------------
User: Correct, you understand the situation, correct, that is what I want to do.
Coach: "Great, and on a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your current state of being on your desired routine?"
--------------------------------------------------
User: หรืออาจมี 2 คนอยากมี
Coach: “ฟังดูเหมือนเป็นเรื่องสำคัญมากในชีวิตของคุณ คุณให้คะแนนจาก 1 ถึง 10 เอาไว้ครับ?”
--------------------------------------------------
User: Now I see maybe there is a 2 for my current state.
Coach: “Okay, and what would you rate for the 10th?
--------------------------------------------------
User: but it has been I wake up 6 p.m. in the morning and then do some real deep work like I make to do this few days and then breakfast go to gym and you know do some meditation and then continue the whole day become healthy and really productive as I said before why you keep asking these questions
Coach: “Just trying to understand, you mentioned 2, what would you rate for a 10?”
--------------------------------------------------
User: The one I see above is what I rate for 10.
Coach: “Okay, let’s return to the 2.”
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay.
Coach: “May I ask why you rated your current state as a 2?”
--------------------------------------------------
User: Because I don't like it, it's really not healthy, and it's cutting my interaction time with other people. I can lose the entire morning, so I won't be able to reach out to them to call them to discuss about my issue.
Coach: “Yeah, I understand. So can you tell me why you think there is a 2 and what you really want to do?”
--------------------------------------------------
User: What I really want to do is to wake up early and have a healthy routine.
Coach: “Okay, I see there’s a 2 and you really want to get to a 10. What do you think is on the way? What do you think is preventing you from having such a routine?”
--------------------------------------------------
User: Mainly, I am more productive at night, and I'm quite in the flow, so I don't want to stop normally, and normally I don't feel it is enough for the day, so I don't want to call it an end. I think that is the main thing that prevents me from sleeping, and then prevents me from waking up.
Coach: “Okay, so you feel more productive at night, and that’s what makes it hard for you to sleep early. Understanding this, what do you think is the way forward to address this conflict?”
--------------------------------------------------
User: Like I said, a hard cutting point. Some people tell me to get a baby because baby will wake up and will sleep.
Coach: “Okay, so you need something external to help you. Besides that, what do you think could help?”
