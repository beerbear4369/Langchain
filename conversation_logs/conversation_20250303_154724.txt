User: Yeah, I want to lose weight, but I found it hard to stick to the routine I set for myself.
Coach: The first thing that comes to my mind is how you defined and set the routine for yourself.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, I want to jog for at least three times a week and go to the gym to do strength training for at least three times a week as well.
Coach: So, you're aiming to jog three times a week and do strength training at the gym three times a week. What do you think is making it hard for you to stick to this routine?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, I find it hard because A is sometimes I don't have the time to exercise. I may have back-to-back meetings for a whole day, and when I want to jog, it's already too late. It's, say, 8, 9 p.m., or I go to the gym. The gym at my condo actually closes at 10, so even if I do have the time and want to do so at 9.30, it's not available. And also there are times where I may get injury, I need to recover, so I cannot do, like, six exercises a week.
Coach: So, you mentioned two main barriers: lack of available time due to meetings and potential injuries that require recovery. Let's explore these factors. How often do you find that meetings interfere with your workout plans?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Ah, meetings maybe two to three days a week.
Coach: So, if meetings take up two to three days a week, that leaves you with at least four days for flexibility. How does that affect your available time for working out?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, yeah, it's not saying I don't exercise at all, I do exercise like three, four times a week, but I want to do six, and that's what's bothering me.
Coach: So, you're saying that the real issue isn't the lack of time—since you're already exercising three to four times a week—but the frustration of not being able to stick to the six times a week that you've planned. What do you think is the root cause of this inconsistency?
--------------------------------------------------
User: It's still a lack of time. Yeah, I do have days, but say I cannot do jog and gym on the same day. I need to actually leave enough time for recovery. So, yeah, it's not saying I don't have time, but I don't have time in that specific day to exercise.
Coach: Okay, so it's about having enough time on specific days to do both jogging and gym. Considering this, what do you think is the main barrier to sticking to your six times a week routine?
--------------------------------------------------
User: As I mentioned earlier, I think it's a lack of time as well as injury.
Coach: Alright, so let's dive into how each of these factors—lack of time and potential injuries—are playing a role in your routine. You mentioned you get injured sometimes. How often does that happen, and how long does it typically take for you to recover?
--------------------------------------------------
User: It doesn't happen that often, fortunately, but every time I get injured, it takes quite some time to recover. So, for example, I injured my elbow and then I could not go to the gym for like three months.
Coach: Wow, that's a significant impact. And how frequently do you get injured, would you say?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Maybe like once or twice a year.
Coach: So, considering you might be out for three months due to an injury once a year, that could significantly impact your routine. How do you factor in the possibility of injury when planning your workouts?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, I'm not sure how to factor that in. I wouldn't be able to know when and how I'd get injured when I make the plan.
Coach: Okay, so it seems like the unpredictability of injuries makes it hard to plan around them. Now, if we were to adjust your six times a week plan to account for potential injuries, what do you think would be a more realistic approach?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, I don't want to, it's just my six times a week plan.
Coach: So, you're really committed to that six times a week plan. But considering the potential for injury and your current schedule, do you think there's a way to build in some flexibility to help you stick to the plan?
