User: Yeah, I want to lose weight, but I found it hard to keep up with the routine I set for myself.
Coach: What do you think is the main challenge in sticking to your routine?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, sometimes I find that I simply don't have the time, right? I have to work, I have to take care of the kids. Also injury is another issue. Sometimes I get injured and I cannot go to the gym for quite some time. So these things add up together. I still exercise now and then, but I'm probably at 50% of the plan I set for myself.
Coach: So, if I understand correctly, you have two main challenges: time management due to family and work commitments, and occasional injuries that disrupt your routine. Is that correct?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, that's correct.
Coach: What do you think could be a possible solution to address these challenges?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't know. I mean, if I had known, I wouldn't be talking to you.
Coach: How would you approach a friend who has similar challenges?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Ah, that's a good question. I may tell him, say, hey, don't be hard on yourself, doing 50% is not, it's not a bad thing. It's way more than not exercising at all.
Coach: Exactly. And perhaps you could apply the same approach to yourself. How would you begin to do that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: well I'm not sure if I want to do that because maybe I have a higher bar for myself
Coach: What do you think is the reason behind having a higher bar for yourself?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Oh, that's a good one. I don't know, because maybe deep in my heart I think I'm better than my friends, so while I think it's okay for them not to do it, I think for me I should be able to do something that my friends are not.
Coach: So, if I understand correctly, you have a perception that you have higher capabilities or standards for yourself compared to your friends, and that influences how you view your own efforts in fitness. Is that right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Maybe. At the same time, I would say my BMI is higher. I'm definitely in the overweight region, so I think also I need to actually have a high bar. It's probably okay if my friends only exercise three times a week because they are already fit, but for me to lose weight, I need to work harder.
Coach: I understand. So, could you clarify what you think is a more appropriate standard or outcome for your fitness routine, considering both your capabilities and your health goals?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, I set to work out six times a week, jog three times, and gym for strength training another three times. I still want to achieve that. Right now, as mentioned, I probably do 50% of that, but if I can, I still want to achieve 100%.
Coach: Just to clarify, are you satisfied with the 50% you are currently doing, or do you feel you need to push more to get to the 100% you mentioned?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, I feel a need to push for more than that.
Coach: What do you think could be a more realistic and sustainable level of commitment that you could aim for, given the challenges we discussed?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, I want to get to the six times per week, right? I really want to.
Coach: How do you feel about the idea of starting with a slightly reduced frequency, perhaps to four times a week, and then gradually increasing it as you feel more comfortable?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess that's a possible method, but then the question is how do I get to 4, right? Because right now on average I only do 3, and I'm already trying very hard.
Coach: What do you think has been preventing you from doing more than 3 times a week, even with the awareness of these challenges?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, it's obviously challenges, right? Injury and time of commitment.
Coach: So, just to clarify, you mentioned that you have a hard stop for work at 6pm. Do you currently have any time allocated for exercise after 6pm?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I do not have time for work at 6 p.m. I sometimes I need to have calls in the evening I may have some work I need to finish by the time I look up from my desktop and want to say go to the gym it's already 930 and the gym at my condo closed at 10 so I simply don't have the time to do it
Coach: So, if I understand correctly, you have a hard stop for work at 6pm. Do you currently have any time allocated for exercise after 6pm?
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, I do not have a hard start for work at 6pm.
Coach: Just to clarify, you mentioned that you have a hard stop for work at 6pm. Do you currently have any time allocated for exercise after 6pm?
