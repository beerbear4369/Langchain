Coach: Hi Ian, how’re you today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Very great. Thank you. And you?
Coach: I'm doing great, Ian. Thank you for asking.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, so shall we start? What should we talk about today?
Coach: Okay so, Victoria, what do you want to explore today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, my name is Ian. Why you call me Victorinox? I want to explore my sleep issue.
Coach: Oh. Have you tried anything to fix that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, I've been talking to many people, but I didn't really find the right way that is actionable to resolve it.
Coach: I'm so glad you're not talking to a Victorinox knife. So let me ask you, what do you want to achieve after our conversation?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I want to achieve, be able to have a healthy sleep schedule, be able to wake up early in the morning, sleep early in the night.
Coach: Notice the coachee’s response lacks emotional depth. The coach may suspect there’s an emotional component not being expressed. 

Coach:
	• Uses “What” question to unlock the coachee’s underlying desire.
	• “So what would having that [sleep] schedule do for you?”
Human:
--------------------------------------------------
User: Having this sleep schedule will make me feel more productive, more successful.
Coach: After seeing whether ru can access my profile thought this.
