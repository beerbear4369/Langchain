User: Hello, I want to talk about my sleeping issue. I cannot have a very healthy sleep routine. I sleep very late, become very late. I want to change this behavior.
Coach: Isabelle, you mentioned that you want to talk about your sleeping issue. Can you tell me more about that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: My name is Ian. I am not Isabel. So basically I sleep very late in the night, like 10 p.m., and like, sorry, like 4 a.m. in the early morning, and then I wake up also quite late, like in the afternoon. I want to change this because this makes me able to have the morning working time, and I miss quite a lot of calls, you know, I cannot go to gym. I wake up, then have a lunch, a very short half-day of work, and then the night comes again. It becomes dark, so I really want to change this. I want to do it in the right time zone, not the other time zone.
Coach: And what time do you actually want to go to sleep and wake up?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I'm going to go to sleep at 10 p.m. and then able to wake up at 6 a.m. in the morning.
Coach: Okay, so you're sleeping from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. What time are you currently going to bed and waking up?
--------------------------------------------------
User: like I said I go to bed at 4 a.m. and wake up at like 12 p.m. in the afternoon
Coach: So, you're aiming for a sleep schedule of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., but currently, you're going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking up around 12 p.m. What do you think is the root cause of your late sleep schedule?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, I guess the root cause is I'm getting very productive at night, I'm really in the flow when I work at night, and then I don't want to stop. So I keep track of the time I go to bed, so it becomes late and late and late, and it's cannot be late anymore, yeah, and I only feel sleepy when it's early the next morning. I think that's a fundamental issue, because sometimes many things come in, I just feel I didn't finish enough in the day and I don't want to go to bed to kill the day, you know?
Coach: I see. So you feel that stopping your work at night would mean losing productive time, making you reluctant to adhere to an earlier bedtime. What would you like to explore in this session to help you make the change?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I would like to explore any possible actions, ways that I can really take to solve this issue to be able to live the healthy routine that I would like to do because I really cannot control myself I feel.
Coach: Okay, Ian, let's dive into this. You mentioned that you're very productive at night, and that productivity is making it hard for you to go to sleep at the desired time. Could you share more about what action or change could help you adjust your routine?
