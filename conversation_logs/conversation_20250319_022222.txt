User: Hello, what is my name?
Coach: Let's dive into that awareness together. What might be your name today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I think my name is Ian today.
Coach: Ian, what would you like to explore in our time today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I guess we can talk about my business. You know I have ongoing construction business which generates me cash flow, but I'm personally more interested in the AI adventure, like training a chatbot or doing AI agent.
Coach: So, Ian, what's the situation you're facing in your business?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Wow, I guess it's like, you know, currently I'm doing the business and it's like actually I don't want to really spend much time and effort doing it, I just automatically pick up and there are many projects and actually in April, in the coming months, I think we have confirmed 3 projects to deliver and if we are lucky, maybe we can get 5. So it's really pick up suddenly and I know it will consume me a lot of energy and time. On the other side, I'm very interested in developing AI applications, like small apps. Because I don't know, I enjoy the feeling when I'm building some applications and I also don't like to be like, really like doing flooring, you know, like construction things. It's really not my thing to be so dirty and sweaty every day and deal with workers and deal with, you know, the people that is like low education level and only fighting for money. That is not what I want to do. I want to do something more adventure, more like AI, you know, more futuristic and create something that benefits the user. Yeah, so that's the situation but it's like, sometimes I just like coding the whole day and forget about my construction business and it is like, yeah, but like basically there's two modes and when they're shifting between two modes, I think it's really inefficient. Like I develop slowly and make the AI, the venture become more like a joke, you know, more like a CCA kind of things rather than a serious startup. Because it's moving so slow and I always have interrupts because of the construction business. But on the other side, I cannot totally give up the construction business because number one, I still need that to generate me cash flow and number two, I have staff and they also continue to earn money. So, it's like so responsible just let it go, right? Unless I just fire them and also having quite a lot of materials, existing stock in my warehouse. So, I need to take care of it, like at least clear it off, right? So, you can stop. So, if you are on a machine for the construction business, I feel it's like I'm on a machine that is not able to stop. Just keep going and I'm part of the machine. I need to go with the machine and that is not what I want. It's like if you ask me to imagine after five years, I don't want to do the flooring business. I don't want to be like, oh, this is a foreign business boss. That's not the tech I want. I want to be a startup guy, right? In tech industry.
Coach: 
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so that is my story.
Coach: You mentioned that you feel like you're part of a machine that you cannot stop. What is the machine that you want to be part of?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, I guess I want to be, I want to be like the machine is moving towards the future. You know, like having a close team, tech driven, people really smart, think about future, think about humanity, think about doing something great, innovative, rather than like, you know, just earning more, consuming more, selling more, borrowing material, yeah, I think that is the things.
Coach: I’m excited to explore this with you.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, yep.
Coach: What would you like to explore today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think I'm a bit confused so yeah what do you think I want to explore today?
Coach: What is my name?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't know, what is your name?
Coach: Ian, what would you like to explore in our time today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Oh my god, you fell into this dead loop again.
Coach: I'm here to help you think through your challenges.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Is it because when I speak too long, the input is so long, it is hard for you to recite?
Coach: I might not be able to provide a response to that right now.
--------------------------------------------------
User: 오케이
Coach: Of course, I can help with that. Let's dive into the topic you want to explore.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so give me a summary of what I have talked about before.
Coach: Sure. You mentioned feeling like a part of a machine you can't stop, specifically your construction business. You’re drawn to AI ventures and desire to create something innovative and futuristic. Yet, you feel conflicted because the construction business provides cash flow and responsibilities to your staff.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, so what next?
Coach: How do you feel about that reflection?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, it's like, that's the current situation, it's like, if you ask me, is it like I die down to do the flooring? Actually, also no. Like, it's earning money. I like to earn money, right? And I need it for my living. To buy some things, to buy a better car, you know, for the things that I like. I need it. But I also like the AI things. And honestly, I'm not so confident. There's a confidence in it. Many times I feel I just play with myself, it's like playing a tool. It's like an escape from the reality.
Coach: So, Ian, what’s the outcome you’d like to achieve today from our conversation?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I like to come back home able to tell that I don't know maybe if I can think of the way to better balance these two you know to be able to more efficiently construction business and also be more efficient you know in the AI adventure yeah that would be I do right it's like him I can get the sugar from both
Coach: You mentioned wanting a better balance between your construction business and your AI venture. What would a better balance look like for you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: well that's a good question a better balance it's like I don't need to worry about the conversion business it's just auto run and they just collect money every month every year and I can put all my energy and time into the adventure I can be Singapore over whichever the place that having my team and we sit down together every day and coding together we think about how to do it and they're doing it tell me I do to me
