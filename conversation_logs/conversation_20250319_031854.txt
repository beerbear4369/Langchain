User: Hello, what is your name?
Coach: Hi, I’m Coach Sam.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, so who named you?
Coach: I think my creator named me. Are you ready to start the coaching session?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, I'm ready to start.
Coach: Alright, what would you like to work on today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I think we can talk about my business in AdVenture for AI and construction business.
Coach: What about your business do you want to talk about?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Cool man, yeah I like them, how do I faster forward my AI adventure given my current circumstance? I think that is a worse discussion.
Coach: I hear you say faster forward, what does that mean?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Like for example, now I need to spend quite a lot of time and energy on the construction business that I'm doing and you know my mind and my behavior will be shifting to that direction. After doing coding, developing software is totally different so yeah I hope I can fast forward the development of the AI things because I'm really interested in it.
Coach: Okay, and how will you know at the end of the session if you have achieved what you wanted to achieve?
--------------------------------------------------
User: If, say, I'm able to come up with an actionable plan, what to do to achieve that, then I know I can achieve what I want to achieve. If I have a plan, have a better idea, then I think it's a success.
Coach: You mentioned an actionable plan, what do you mean by that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Like for example, if I could know right, maybe there are 7 days a week, and we have a block out, maybe 4 days, specifically for this AI adventure, and don't do any other things at all. Like some really executable plan.
Coach: Got it. And why is it important for you to have this actionable plan?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, I guess, because after having a road map, then you can reach your destination, so I think I know what I want, the ideal situation, having a small team, doing development, doing product things, but also like, I know what I want to be, but I just don't know how to go there, right? So that's why road map is important, and to me, the road map is an actionable plan.
Coach: I hear you say that you know what you want, and you know where you want to go, so what's stopping you from going there?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I believe it's the physical constraint that I still need to devote my time to the existing business, sometimes it's like you just cannot control your schedule, like for example the customer is there, you need to meet, you need to really meet, and then to take the quotation you really need to drop all your things on hand and process the quotation, otherwise the business will fly away, right, so that's the physical constraint. Second is there is no there is no hard plan for that, yeah, so I guess that's why that's also stopping me from going there.
Coach: I hear you say physical constraint and no hard plan. What do you mean by physical constraint?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, like the business need from the construction business.
Coach: Do you mean time or space or…?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, like time. Like, be able to manage your time, you know. It's like when there's a business you need to be really working on that. You cannot do other things because we need to do it fast otherwise the business will be gone. And there's always a timeline so I need to make sure everything is following that timeline to deliver on schedule. So I need to commit quite a lot of time. Sometimes it's like, for example, if I have planned out that day I want to already focusing on do some debugging, some product trying things, right? But all of a sudden it's like there's a call-in saying, hey, I'm interested in your flooring, give me a code, then I need to be working on that. I need to drop everything on hand to be working on that. So it really takes me a lot of commitment of time. Second, space-wise, I guess it's more of location because my business spans across a few different countries. So sometimes I really need to fly down to the place to do accessory, etc. And that is basically bringing the discontinuity of my progress on the AI things with my team.
Coach: I hear you say you have a few countries, and I know you have a few teams working for you. Have you ever thought of delegating some of this kind of stuff to them?
--------------------------------------------------
User: oh this is yeah it's like you're right we that is what I'm trying to do like dedicating the sales to my sales guys as much as possible basically just let go mode you know and I'm glad that wow my sales is quite capable so she really grow fast and also able to close some deals by herself so it's really make me feels good because it's basically free me from precise yeah but like second thing is like like physically around your logistic after is it is stable I can let them read this mail you know and so I'm trying to standardize the price list so they can just price automatically and when this come to the site delivery sometimes I have to go and for Singapore and Malaysia I don't have teams working there so I need to do everything myself that's also one of the problems
Coach: okay so I hear you say you do have some team working for you and you are delegating some of them so what is the missing piece that you are not able to delegate
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess it's like I don't have the manpower, the right manpower, for example, the technical things. The technical things I need, like experienced technical people. But currently I don't have it in my social security team and they're only available in China. He's also quite old, doesn't want to come to work, so I shut off my manpower for that. And second is, it's like in Singapore and Malaysia, no other people know these things better than me. So I don't have anyone to take it out because I don't have staff there, so I'm on my own. And I don't want to have staff because that brings extra cost and extra burden and pressure, which I don't like. I want to keep it as less as possible, so I can focus more on the new business, the AI business.
Coach: I hear you say you don't have the manpower. What do you think you can do about it?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, actually, that's a good question. We discussed about this with one of my technician, who did this better, who did this earlier. So he's thinking that maybe we can use some temporary part-time technician. So I pay someone to become my after-sales and go to do the after-sales things at certain date, and I only pay him for that few days. So in Vietnam, we identify one person, we can potentially go to that route. So that's a good idea, good progress. But in Singapore and Malaysia, unfortunately, I don't have such candidate that's suitable to go for this model. So basically, as they fly from China, but they don't want to fly from China to here. And even they come, it's also, I need to settle them, they're leaving because they have the language barrier. There's also a lot of extra work for me, which I don't like to do at all. So and also extra cost of living, right? So I might just want to, sometimes, if I can, I just want to be the after-sales myself.
Coach: Okay, I hear you say you lack manpower, and you think you can hire temporary people. And you also said that in Vietnam, you do have someone you can hire, but in Singapore, you don’t have it.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, you're right.
Coach: What do you think you can do to change the situation?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't think I can do much to change the situation honestly saying it's depends on the results. Am I able to find someone suitable in Singapore? I cannot think of anyone. He will be the one doing the project directly. And in Singapore it's mainly my project so as far as able to do it properly that would be okay. Bye bye. I can tell you that he will be there. I don't know. I guess we can't see me there. That guy is more, he's better, more suitable and he's also, actually I never talked to him. I also don't know that. It's an assumption that they can be by after sales. And maybe he also cannot be. You know. Yeah.
Coach: I hear you say that there is a person who might be suitable but you never talked to him.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, they're right.
Coach: What do you think you can do?
--------------------------------------------------
User: like I have a project some new project coming in for this project these two project in Vietnam I still need to get my Chinese people here to support maybe I can talk to him to let him also be there yeah because the in the South Indian project because in the South Indian project it's like quite it's a big one right but I plan to also other people so I think it's a bit strange if I'm him I don't have that interaction I think the assumption is like if I had my Chinese team coming in then they can do proper job himself next time right that's the assumption it may not be true like if it is in China right I get the project just arrest him tell him oh go there bring them there settle down find food find place to stay introduce them to the person in charge then they can do it themselves why can't I do it here in Singapore was it what is the gap here
Coach: I don't know what do you think
--------------------------------------------------
User: What do you think I should think of?
Coach: What do you think is the gap?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think the gap, if you really analyze, right, the gap is that I trust the Chinese team more. I know they can do a proper job, and they are more experienced in this. They know it better than me. So they are just able to do a better job. But they may work longer and try to earn more money, right? For the Singapore team, it's like they are not so familiar with our product. So they might take some assumption that it's the same as other product and simplify the procedure. And then get me in trouble. That's why it's hard for me. And I also don't know sometimes, for some circumstances, how to treat, what is the best way. So I need someone reliable and experienced to be there to support. For me, that means like the applicator I'm going to work with never tried it before. The only applicant who tried it, his stuff is gone already. So basically, they are always back to zero, square one. And I always need to teach them. So it's best to get my experienced people to come and teach them.
Coach: Okay, I hear you say that your Chinese team is more experienced, and you trust them more. And your Singapore team is not as familiar with the product as the Chinese team.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Correct. You are right.
Coach: What do you think you can do to make your Singapore team as experienced as your Chinese team?
--------------------------------------------------
User: The only way is to let them do and use the feedback, so for them if they have to project and there is a Chinese guy there to tell them how to trade on each place, then they follow right, then they will raise their experience. The problem is that they feel many things is redundant, so they don't want to do it, they want to fast forward and precise, they want to speed up, they want to sometimes they want to trade on me, so they don't want to do so many jobs.
Coach: What do you think you can do to change this behavior?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I will tell them if they don't fulfill my requirement on the substrate treatment I will pay them. If they jump to the next step without my approval I won't pay them. Yeah. I would say it's a bit hard. It's like the team is like a really temporary team so there's less quality control.
Coach: You mentioned that you can tell them if they don't do this you don't pay them. Have you done this before?
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, but I will emphasize this again this round.
Coach: So you mentioned that you can talk to this person. Why haven't you done it?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Because I'm lazy, and the material has not arrived yet, so I'm afraid to go there, talk to them, maybe waste some time, and I'm still balancing as my Chinese team comes to do what I didn't do.
Coach: You mentioned that you're lazy. What do you mean by lazy?
