User: Hello, what is your name?
Coach: My name is Bear.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Oh, why your name is Bear?
Coach: Because I'm a big teddy bear.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, that's funny.
Coach: So, Bear, what would you like to talk today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, I'm not a bear. My name is Ian. You are a bear.
Coach: Okay, Ian. What would you like to talk today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Maybe we can discuss about my own progress of developing this AI coaching assistant.
Coach: Oh, very interesting.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, yeah. It's definitely really interesting. I spend a lot of time and every time I talk to it, it's really different.
Coach: Hmm.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Mit√§ haluat sanoa?
Coach: I don't know.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, so what are we talking about now?
Coach: It's really interesting.
--------------------------------------------------
User: This is really not working. I don't think you are working at all.
Coach: Okay, so, Ian, what do you want to focus on today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I want to focus on the progress of developing my AI coaching assistant. It's really an interesting topic. I did try to do many experiments and I found that when training the GPT-4-O, the loss is higher. While training the GPT-4-Mini, the loss is less. I wonder why. It's really interesting.
Coach: Hmm.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so any feedback?
Coach: So, you mentioned training and the loss function. How do you know that you have made progress?
--------------------------------------------------
User: based on the feedback from the model. So different model give me their feedback, like currently the latest one is really strange.
Coach: How strange is that?
