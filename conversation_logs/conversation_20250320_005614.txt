User: Hello, I want to discuss about my progress in terms of the AI chatbot building.
Coach: Whatâ€™s your desired outcome you want to see from this conversation?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess, like a clear view of the progress, how to achieve my target, like I said to finish the MVP in two weeks and that was a great session, you know, I managed to prioritize what is important and I take immediate action right now to implement a different code change to try a different memory strategy. I think that's really moving to the right direction, slightly more focusing on the important things and put aside the good to have features at the moment. Yeah, so with this session, I'm happy to see that if you're able to have some concrete plan or action tips, right, that make sure we successfully launch the MVP after two weeks high.
Coach: So what I heard that you wanted to launch the MVP in two weeks, and you are a little bit concerned about the progress and you want to see a more concrete plan in place to help you achieve that goal.
--------------------------------------------------
User: All right. You got it. 
Coach: And how would you know that you have achieved the goal or the outcome by the end of the session?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, it's the end of the session. We're having a good time, getting actionable, able to break down, and now I can feel it. It really leads me to entertain with these songs.
Coach: So how would you rate your confidence level to achieve a big goal on a scale of one to ten?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I'll see you on Saturday.
Coach: What was it before the session?
--------------------------------------------------
User: What was it before the session? No, I mean like now we haven't really talked about anything, right? So it was 7. After some exploration, we can raise it to 10.
Coach: How would you describe a successful MVP launch? What would it look like?
