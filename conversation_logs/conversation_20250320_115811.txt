User: Hello, my name is Ian.
Coach: Hi Ian, thanks for joining. What would you like to explore today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: So, I want to talk about my progress of building the AI chatbot.
Coach: That sounds interesting. What does successful progress look like for you on this chatbot project?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Successful progress is like, now we define that we need to ship out the MVP within 2 weeks. So successful progress means able to finish this task and able to ship out our things in 2 weeks. Successful progress is like, now we define that we need to ship out the MVP within 2 weeks.
Coach: Thanks for defining that clearly. Can you describe what's happening now with your MVP progress? What steps have you taken so far and what challenges are you encountering?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, I guess what's happening now with MVP Progress is that I'm building it, so we are like monitoring the results to handle the corresponding history because it's like AI research, so after a long conversation, sometimes we get an issue that it is not so, the model is starting to respond in a loop. So we currently are resolving that issue, and I think we're making good progress because I, from this test, I do see it's performing better. And the challenge is that, now I'm trying to block my time to, like, in the morning to only focusing on this AI project and in the afternoon on other business, but you know like sometimes things just come to me, like now my contractor is coming in with a big project and I'm in a hurry about the material, so I really need to handle that, I cannot let it wait. So that is still the challenge that we are encountering.
Coach: Thanks for sharing that. How do these interruptions affect your focus, and what has worked for you in managing similar challenges before?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Good question, like, it's affect my mood, you know, because when I'm thinking about one thing, sometimes I just like, because sometimes it's the some idea just pop out, so when you are really focusing on it, and basically when it's shifting my attention, I tend to drop that and lose that focus, so once you lose that focus, lose that flow, right, you tend to be less productive, you tend to, because now I think the point is to identify what is the major mistake, what is the major things to improve, and then we can use the AI to research, use the actual code to resolve it, so the key problem is to identify what is the gap, and find the direction, and the detailed application we can give to AI, you know, so being able to solve the problem need you to be really committed intensely, and what have worked for me in managing single challenge before, like, this is a good question, only thing is, like, remind me about, like, previously when I was like switching from my full-time job in SenseTime to do this foreign business, I also had the same issue, because I need to switch between two manage, so I didn't manage that properly actually, like, so that's why I decided to quit that job in total and fully commit to working at the time, yeah, so
Coach: Thanks for sharing that detailed context. Could you describe a recent moment when your focus slipped? What did you notice in your thoughts and reactions?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I'm quite impressed by O3E module, now I feel that maybe I'm wasting a lot of time just trying to do the fine-tuning, maybe the parameter interaction is the best, you know, why don't I test this earlier, okay I guess like the recent moment is like 10 minutes early, that as a side the applicator just come in with the message and then I need to respond to the game and this affect me, like I'm actually in the blocking time to think about AI things right but this is like dragging me to that direction and actually currently I'm still thinking about that, I'm quite worried about that as well. So in my thought and reaction, I guess it's like I tend to just like be switching to that topic and forget about my AI progress, but because of this session I know that I should block time for AI right, otherwise if you just progress slowly and that is also not good to me in the long run. So I feel the reaction of like I need to be physically advancing but mentally it's getting distracted and I really don't like that, I want to be able to really focus on what I'm working at the moment, I don't like other things disturbing.
Coach: That sounds very challenging. Could you describe what a truly focused session would feel like for you, and how that contrasts with these moments of distraction?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Oh, good question. So, truly focus session is like, you know, at night, I'm just working on the things I like to do. Don't have any interruption from outside. The moment of distraction is like in the daytime, because I'm doing like a sales company for the flooring, you know. So, the nature of it is like, well, coordinate with many, many people. It's basically mainly coordination, rather than sit down, right? Work out a proposal or work out a contract. It's more like collaboration, connect to people, talk to people. So it's really different. I mean, I just don't want to get interrupted from the focus time.
Coach: It sounds like you’ve noticed a clear distinction between when you can deeply focus and the times when interruptions naturally occur. What options do you see for shielding your focus sessions, especially during the daytime?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Good question, why I think one of the focus session is that in the day time probably I can just like turn on the don't disturb mode but can only let it run for 30 minutes maybe so I don't receive those messages and interruptions and also keep response within the time that could work, alternatively is just like I adjust my schedule like wake up really early in the morning and be really deep focus on what I like to do second way is like I am just, you know like what is the second way? I believe the second way is like we just totally yeah like move my focus mode to day time or night time when no one disturbs me and keep the 9 to 6 ready for the foreign things, for the interruptions but it's like then my working hour will be too long and unsustainable so I probably need to shorten my working day time you know, but it's like it's actually not up to me, it's up to when I receive message I respond immediately
Coach: You've identified two possibilities. What do you see as the benefits and potential challenges with each? And are there any other options you might consider?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I can't think of other options, okay one is to just like block the time right and turn on the administer mode, the benefit is like I don't need to wake up too early and do like working on a daily time, you know, so it's more like a normal person, benefit is like I don't need to have major shift in my schedule, wake up too early or sleep too early, but the challenge is that after 30 minutes of blockage, I will review the message right and then like for example, when I text others, they may not reply very fast, they may reply after 5 minutes, then if I like come to the deep focus module, forget about the message after half hour, then it will be really slow, so it will make the progress of the coordination really slow because of this arrangement and yeah, so that's the challenge and the adjustment schedule, I think it's like they don't have this challenge of like a slowing response in the coordination job and I think it can really block me from distraction, you know, and I think that it really works, that's the benefit, benefit is that I'm really deep focused, no one can disturb me and when I'm in coordinate mode, I'm also really coordinating, I won't let things go, and the challenge is like how to adjust my energy, so basically, I will be wake up early in the morning, working for couple of hours and then in the coordination mode, then I need to set a time for the coordination mode, so I can have enough rest, I guess, and this thing is like, time is easy to manage, but your mental energy is hard, so if there is issue for the construction business, because I'm the owner, right, so it matters, if there is mistake, there will be a loss, yeah, so I also need to think about that.
Coach: What adjustments might help minimize coordination delays while preserving your deep focus?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I cannot think of any adjustment, minimize the financial delay, otherwise like you see message that don't respond, it's not urgent, don't respond that is urgent, but your mentor is getting distracted from it, so that is not good. I don't think there is like any way to adjust it, maybe you could propose.
Coach: I hear you. When you consider the trade-offs, what small experiment might you try to see if you can balance fast responses and deep focus better?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think, like, I'm seeing like a trend to block a time earlier. Maybe not like wake up 4 a.m. in the morning, that's too extreme, instead like working 7 a.m. in the morning, and work dog, settle every routine, and be in the deep mode from 8 p.m. to like 10 p.m., sorry, 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. for two hours, right, like two hours of deep focus, and handle the day-to-day coordination job, you could try that, and after 6, basically the work stop, right, then I come back to the deep focus mode, so instead of continuing deep focusing for 4 hours, 8 hours, I chop it to 8 to 10 a.m., and also 6 to 10 p.m., so for 6 hours a day, right, I think that, maybe that could work, because I, you know, the reason I want to do it in the morning, because I think in the morning you also have the most motivation to do the heavy lifting things, so we should do the hardest thing in the morning, and I feel the MVP is like, sometimes I feel once you put it aside, it's a bit hard to resume, because like, you know, the road might become less clear, and we don't know where to pick up again, yeah, so that would make it less good, you know, so doing it in the morning, then I have the highest energy, and also do it at night, when I have the most time, but deep focus mode, and 2 things I can think of, and secondly, secondly, I guess, I don't know, secondly, I guess, what did I say, I forget what I'm saying, so secondly, I guess, yeah, like, doing everything is also helpful, because once you stop, like I said, the road might become unclear, and you feel it's like, I don't know how to pick up, and then you feel there's like reluctance, there's like an obstacle from blocking you from doing it, so I think the best way to keep this going, have a good progress, is just continue doing it every day, and progress every day, and maintain the momentum, yeah.
Coach: It sounds like you’ve mapped a thoughtful day structure. What signpost will tell you this new schedule is truly preserving your momentum on the MVP?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I'm sorry I don't understand the question, can you rephrase the question again?
Coach: What recognizable changes or results would indicate that this new schedule is effectively boosting your MVP progress?
--------------------------------------------------
User: great question I think few things I guess like behavior right so if I start to pick up this behavior then I know it is doing that and how effective how to check whether it's effective is by the MVP progress like I have to do this I can see how fast that the to-do list is being cleared and how fast MVP is getting shipped out how is the new feature getting shipped out
Coach: What specific indicators will confirm your routine's effectiveness, and if progress slows, how might you adjust your approach?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Like I said, the specific indicator is like the feature released every day, so if I can measure that, I can measure the progress. If we run slow combat, I adjust my approach, I think it's from like learning, right? Like I said, I didn't start off with methodology, it's nothing wrong, but keep learning and iterate from it. That is a really good method. So if progress slow, so I do the experiment and see if it's slower than now, I guess less likely, or if it's faster than now, right? If it's faster than now, then I'll be happy with it, and maybe if it's not fast enough to my expectation, then from the real feeling about how's my day been going, I'll be able to see the obstacle, and then think about the way to adjust again.
Coach: What's the one action you'll take tomorrow to kick off this schedule experiment, and how will you track your progress?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think the one action is like to wake up at 7am, get an alarm at 7am, and do my routine, maybe some exercise, maybe not exercise, we'll see how, and we can try to progress by recording the number of hours I really spent on this, and record the number of times that I really spent developing this product versus other things, so I think that is a good way to keep track of progress.
Coach: That sounds like a concrete plan. How will you ensure you record your progress consistently, and do you have any support set up to help keep you accountable?

Coach: I'm not sure I caught your meaning. Could you explain what you meant in another way?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't like this concept of being accountable I don't like to be accountable I don't like to be responsible I have freedom It's like controversy, right? I don't know why people ask me how can I be accountable If I do this, what is good? If I don't do this, what is bad? So I think if I'm able to do this consistently for the last few days when I'm still in Singapore I think it would be Let me count Friday, Saturday Sunday, Monday Tuesday, 5 days If I can do 5 days in a row I will probably buy myself something I really like I think that's a good way to reward myself Because I just need to record Instead of making sure I count within the hour I just need to record The way of recording is the small things
Coach: How does rewarding yourself for five consecutive days align with your view of freedom, and what might you discover while tracking these small wins?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Like, view of freedom is like what to follow, is to follow your instinct or to follow your own rhythm, right? So if you follow your rhythm, you get freedom because you, like what is freedom in the end of day, right? That's a good topic. I believe freedom is to go where you can, want, achieve, to not. And I think if I do this continuously for 5 days, I am able to ship out LFP and that is the ultimate freedom I like to have, rather than with cheap, easy lower running foot, yeah. So, one of my discoveries when tracking with small wings, I don't know, it's like I hope I could learn better about myself as well, like what do I like, is that I am just driven by the instinct or feedback from the development, or I want to achieve some higher goals. It's actually, that's a really inspiring question, you know? I think we should dump all the previous job and just stick with this O3 model, because it's just fucking good, and make my previous experiments like a joke, you know? I should have done this earlier. Like what I said, because I have been wanting to do R&D, wanting to do a new industry, and I have done a researcher job before, but I feel I am a bit impatient waiting for the outcome to come. Like I don't fail a thousand times and win one time, I need more immediate feedback. So, controversially, the real freedom, the real great goal, right? Go to Mars, this kind of thing is done by continuous failure, it's by really like a really small step, and don't see the positive response in a short period of time. So whether I am able to be persistent, aiming for the big goal, right? I think that could also be a sad discovery to get my taste.
Coach: It sounds like you're using immediate rewards as a way to honor your natural rhythm. How might tracking these small wins help you distinguish between momentary instinct and a deeper drive toward your long-term innovation goals?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess checking the small wins is like because sometimes it's up and down, right? So checking the small wins is like also helping me to collect the confidence. Keep collecting checks, collecting confidence could like even to tell myself that hey I'm a good person, I'm really contributing a lot to it and by small wins we accumulate to big wins and I am able to do something significant rather than just do something really simple easy to do. Because the momentary, this thing is like oh once you have that demand you just do it like crazy but after a while once it's declined you may just drop it. I think that's the problem of me. I sometimes really get interested in it but once the stone goes well, once there's an obstacle I'm not that persistent.
Coach: It sounds like you've recognized that small wins build confidence—and that there's a challenge when obstacles arise. What might you do in those moments to remind yourself of your progress and maintain persistence?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, I mean this is what I'm doing as well, it's like, like I somehow just check my to-do list, check the done part, you know, oh hey, we have made so much progress, it's not like currently you feel it's a total failure, we have real progress, we have learned a lot and we are on the right track, it's just some small issues, you know, and if I really checking the number of hours I commit to these things, I think it's even better, it's like, hey, you are not what you think, you are not rubbish, you really dedicate so many hours of hard work to it, yeah, so this like, basically it's like if you lead a team, wins, sells, it's the best motivation, it's the best booster, right, so pre-risk means pre-risk size is the best booster, yeah.
Coach: How can you use your progress records to keep you moving forward when challenges arise?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Let me just use this as evidence, like a history success to show myself, to tell myself that this is just another challenge, I can overcome it as I overcome those challenges beforehand. I believe there's a lot of power in belief and previous success is a good source of belief.
Coach: How might you integrate these reminders of past success into your routine so they naturally support you when challenges arise?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Oh, it's a good suggestion, I'm not sure if this is a good behavior, but for example, I believe that we could have a review day, you know, after one day, before one day, just review the past progress, seeing, I have a conversation with myself, I check, okay, so yesterday, we have accomplished this and this, and on the other side, we have some challenge, like a self-talk, you know, this precisely will help me, like making a routine of reflection, that early day, oh, how many hours I've been working on that, what progress we have made, what challenge we still face, and how much we solve it the other day, maybe we do it at the end of the day, to ramp up everything, yeah, so instead of, oh, I think about that idea, and then I want to implement it immediately, to try it out immediately, that will keep dragging me long, right, so having a wind-down time at night, about to finish the job, and have a reflection, and just reviewing my to-do list, and give myself a developer summary every day, you know, this is a really good way, I guess, and if that can work, actually, I could develop a product just to do that, you know, I think it's a really brilliant idea.
Coach: How might you structure your nightly review to effectively capture successes and challenges, fueling continuous progress?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so I structured it to like a few chapters, so first I talk about how many hours I have committed, how was my day going, and second is like what have I done, right? Just go through what have I done today, so I'm clear what is the treatment, and then the third one would be the potential challenge that I'm facing that I haven't solved, the issue I haven't solved, and the issue I haven't solved, and some new idea, like how to solve it, so maybe I can make it like a chatbot as well, so I talk to it and then record it, and after I record it, you're able to give me a summary as well, yeah, how does that sound? Do it sounds like a good thing to you?
Coach: What do you see as the biggest benefit of using this structured review every night?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, I guess the biggest benefit is like, it makes my day really clear and make it like have this reflection, I am able to come back and know the progress really well. And after I am having this data, we could maybe ask the AI to generate a weekly progress so we can really see the progress better, you know, like, and it's also like, it's just collecting the data and let me be thinking about things in a more structured way. I think it's really a good habit, I really like to try this out. Because now it's really based on feeling, it's like, oh, I have done this, I have done that, and it's totally feeling based, and your feeling could be wrong, but once we have this exercise, we will have a digital footprint, and that won't be wrong.
Coach: How do you envision using that digital footprint to reframe unexpected challenges and guide your next steps?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Um, I, maybe it's like in a day there's like a hard problem that I just cannot solve. So maybe there's something pop up new that I found from the plan, right, from this idea. So I think it's okay to just reshuffle around the priority.
Coach: What signals would help you decide that a new challenge is worth re-prioritizing, and how can you ensure it doesn't derail your review routine?
--------------------------------------------------
User: If it's urgent and important, we will reshuffle.
Coach: How do you decide when a challenge truly meets both criteria of urgent and important, and how will that decision guide your next step in reshuffling priorities?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Sorry, what topic are we discussing today and what are we trying to achieve today?
Coach: Let me make sure I understand: we're talking about designing and using a structured daily review habit. Through this, you're capturing how many hours you've worked, what you've achieved, and any challenges, creating a digital footprint to better inform your weekly progress. Ultimately, the goal is to build accountability and confidence, ensuring that even when obstacles arise, you can re-evaluate and re-prioritize how you move forward. Is that aligned with what you're aiming to achieve today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: We have started a conversation about the progress about building AI chatbots, right? So I think we should focus on that. And I believe we have reached the conclusion of having this like daily routine might benefit that. And we should just run it out and then try to experiment with that rather than keep digging deeper. I think this is the end of this talk.
Coach: Before we close, I'm curious: as you move forward with this daily review routine for your AI chatbot project, what's the first step you'll take tomorrow, and how will you celebrate that initial progress?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Like I said, I wake up early tomorrow morning and have some deep session in the morning and have some deep session at night and have some reflection session after the night and see how does that goes. So I would like to celebrate this, I don't know, just be happy, you know, maybe reward me with something, actually I kind of don't know how to reward myself, you know, like reward myself with what, with some nice drink, yeah, how does that sound, because having a great progress is self-rewarding, it's better than playing a game, so I don't know how to reward myself.
Coach: What aspects of celebrating with a nice drink resonate deeply with you, and could you experiment with other rewards to see which one truly motivates you?
--------------------------------------------------
