User: Hello, I want to talk about my progress of building an AI chatbot.
Coach: Let's start with the outcomes for this session. At the end of the session, how would you know we have a meaningful conversation around your progress?
--------------------------------------------------
User: wow I would like to explore the you know like actually I'm not so sure about it
Coach: Would you say you don't have a clear direction on what you want to achieve?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel the progress. It's like when I zoom in, the whole day working on it, I feel it is fast, because the feedback is really in real time, so I can feel the progress. But I do feel that maybe I'm just rewinding the wheel, because sometimes it's like I'm not an expert in this, and I could be just making so many obvious mistakes, I don't know. It's like previously, the big jump from previous progress is that when I start to see the output of the code to the LLM, and I feel the format is somehow wrong. And just with identifying that issue, I can fix it. It will improve the performance quite a lot.
Coach: So if I'm hearing you correctly, the progress you're making is real time feedback, you can see output every day. But at the same time, you feel that you may be just rewinding the wheel, because you don't know what you don't know, and you may be making obvious mistakes. Would you say that's accurate?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I would rate the progress of five, because I need to keep distracted from the other business. So it's not that fast, we haven't been able to build more team to work on it. The people I work with also do it like a set hassle, so once there is something more urgent, everyone will put this aside.
Coach: And how important is this project to you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess the fundamental reason is that we are doing this at part-time, so if you consider the progress versus the amount of energy and time you invest in, it's fast.
Coach: So if you were to rate the urgency of the project, how would you rate it?
