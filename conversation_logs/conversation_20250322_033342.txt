User: Hello, I want to talk about my progress of building an AI chatbot.
Coach: Great, what about your progress would you like to discuss?
--------------------------------------------------
User: wow I would like to explore the you know like actually I'm not so sure about it
Coach: Not sure about what it is?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel the progress. It's like when I zoom in, the whole day working on it, I feel it is fast, because the feedback is really in real time, so I can feel the progress. But I do feel that maybe I'm just rewinding the wheel, because sometimes it's like I'm not an expert in this, and I could be just making so many obvious mistakes, I don't know. It's like previously, the big jump from previous progress is that when I start to see the output of the code to the LLM, and I feel the format is somehow wrong. And just with identifying that issue, I can fix it. It will improve the performance quite a lot.
Coach: So you are sensing that the progress is fast, but at the same time, you are not sure if you are just recycling the wheel. How do you know that you are not just recycling the wheel?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I would rate the progress of five, because I need to keep distracted from the other business. So it's not that fast, we haven't been able to build more team to work on it. The people I work with also do it like a set hassle, so once there is something more urgent, everyone will put this aside.
Coach: So the main thing that is blocking the progress is the distraction from other business and the commitment level of the team. Is that right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess the fundamental reason is that we are doing this at part-time, so if you consider the progress versus the amount of energy and time you invest in, it's fast.
Coach: Yeah, based on the current context, what do you think the rating should be?
