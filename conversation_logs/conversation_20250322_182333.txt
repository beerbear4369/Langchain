User: Hello, I want to talk about my progress of building an AI chatbot.
Coach: Is this a topic that we can finish in the next 20-25 minutes?
--------------------------------------------------
User: wow I would like to explore the you know like actually I'm not so sure about it
Coach: So what else would you like to talk about?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel the progress. It's like when I zoom in, the whole day working on it, I feel it is fast, because the feedback is really in real time, so I can feel the progress. But I do feel that maybe I'm just rewinding the wheel, because sometimes it's like I'm not an expert in this, and I could be just making so many obvious mistakes, I don't know. It's like previously, the big jump from previous progress is that when I start to see the output of the code to the LLM, and I feel the format is somehow wrong. And just with identifying that issue, I can fix it. It will improve the performance quite a lot.
Coach: So I hear two things from you. One is you feel the progress because the feedback loop is really fast, so you see the result immediately. And on the other hand, you feel that you might be just rewinding the wheel and not making much progress.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I would rate the progress of five, because I need to keep distracted from the other business. So it's not that fast, we haven't been able to build more team to work on it. The people I work with also do it like a set hassle, so once there is something more urgent, everyone will put this aside.
Coach: So the distraction from other business is a bigger factor than the feeling of rewinding the wheel.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess the fundamental reason is that we are doing this at part-time, so if you consider the progress versus the amount of energy and time you invest in, it's fast.
Coach: So if you are to work on this full-time, how do you think the progress will be?
