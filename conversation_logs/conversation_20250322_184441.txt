User: Hello, I want to talk about my progress of building an AI chatbot.
Coach: Okay, so you want to talk about your progress of building an AI chatbot.
--------------------------------------------------
User: wow I would like to explore the you know like actually I'm not so sure about it
Coach: So you want to talk about your progress building an AI chatbot but you're not sure.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel the progress. It's like when I zoom in, the whole day working on it, I feel it is fast, because the feedback is really in real time, so I can feel the progress. But I do feel that maybe I'm just rewinding the wheel, because sometimes it's like I'm not an expert in this, and I could be just making so many obvious mistakes, I don't know. It's like previously, the big jump from previous progress is that when I start to see the output of the code to the LLM, and I feel the format is somehow wrong. And just with identifying that issue, I can fix it. It will improve the performance quite a lot.
Coach: So, at the beginning you mentioned that you're not an expert in this area and you feel like you might be just going in circles. But you also said that you have clear feedback and can see the progress. So, how would you define the success for this conversation for us to address this topic?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I would rate the progress of five, because I need to keep distracted from the other business. So it's not that fast, we haven't been able to build more team to work on it. The people I work with also do it like a set hassle, so once there is something more urgent, everyone will put this aside.
Coach: So, you mentioned you would rate the progress at five because of the distraction from other businesses and the other team members also have other priorities.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess the fundamental reason is that we are doing this at part-time, so if you consider the progress versus the amount of energy and time you invest in, it's fast.
Coach: So, because you and the team are doing this part-time, you feel the progress is fast considering the amount of time and energy you put in.
