User: Hello, I'm feeling a bit down, like, you know, like previously, I have discussed with you about the MVP, and I'm very happy to decide that, okay, let's finish the MVP in two weeks, and then we make, like, some plan to finish some function for the two days, right? And now, it's so slow, after three days of working, I still haven't finished, like, one of the functions as I planned to do. I'm very tired, like, just suddenly don't have energy, I don't know why, maybe because I sleep too much.
Coach: So, you're feeling down because you had a commitment to finish the MVP in two weeks, but after three days of working on it, you're still not done with one of the functions, and it's making you feel tired and lacking energy.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, you're right.
Coach: So, what do you want to talk about this afternoon?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I also don't know what to talk about, I just feel really tired, can you save me, make me feel scattered?
Coach: Okay, so you want to talk about how to get your energy back, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, maybe I don't know how to get my energy back. It seems I can't get my energy back quicker. That's a good thing to have.
Coach: Okay, so if by the end of the session, you have a new perspective on how to get your energy back quicker, how would you know we have succeeded?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Like if I can get energy back from this conversation, I will know I am succeeding, or if I can find a way to get the energy back and implement it in real life, then I will know I am succeeding. Sometimes it's like, after talking to you, I come up with some plan, but I never will be able to execute it, make me feel like a joke, I'm feeling great, oh ok, I know how to solve it, but in the end of the day, I'm not solving it, I didn't implement what you are saying, I don't know why.
Coach: Yeah, I understand. You want to feel like you know how to solve it and actually solve it, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Perhaps.
Coach: So what's different today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: What do you mean?
Coach: You said you want to have energy and actually be able to solve the issue.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, right, that's what that was.
Coach: So what's different today compared to the other times we spoke?
--------------------------------------------------
User: The difference is like, I had an explore session just now, and it makes me feel I have less and I'm just feeling so tired, maybe because the progress is too slow, I don't know why, I'm just so tired, like lost my energy, I don't want to move suddenly, I really don't understand why.
Coach: Yeah, I can see you're not your usual self, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I just like don't even have energy to speak just like all of a sudden no batteries
Coach: Yeah, you mentioned you had an exploration session earlier, and usually after the session, you feel energized, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Early I feel energized, but in the middle of the session I feel low energy, de-energized.
Coach: Yeah, so what do you think is the cause of your low energy?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't know
Coach: You mentioned the slow progress, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: It could be that I didn't eat, didn't sleep, but still slow progress, I could be wrong on the results.
Coach: So it's possible the lack of energy is due to the slow progress, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: It is possible.
Coach: And how do you feel about the slow progress?
--------------------------------------------------
User: After I commit to finish that function in two days, I really want to complete it, right? But now I fail to do that in two days. I am actually still struggling with the first function. So I guess the second function will take quite a long time. And now I doubt my capability to launch that in two weeks. And this is already draining my energy. I have no energy at all to do anything.
Coach: So it's not just the slow progress, but also the doubt in your capability to finish it on time, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, it will be correct. I also doubt my ability to finish in 2 weeks. And also we stuck on another recent project. I guess I also cannot finish it. I say I'm a failure. I just have some random idea and never able to deliver it. Maybe that's the reality. Just like I'm trying to blame myself.
Coach: So all these are draining your energy, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, correct. It's draining a lot of my energy. So physically, I'm also like pushing to a certain boundary. Like I sleep on the floor for two days, but I... It's just like all of a sudden you just feel there's no energy at all, you know?
Coach: So how are you feeling right now?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I'm feeling terrified, I should say, and I'm feeling a little bit anxious, and I'm feeling reluctant to do anything. I actually am so lazy to talk to you. You know, I'm actually quite lazy to talk to you at the moment.
Coach: Yeah, I can see you don't have much energy to speak.

User: Before we put the pan Umidigi A3 into the oven it's time to turn it to 200Â°C Then for it to cook, I've splittered it into four bars Over 2mm diameter It's easier to bake right, take these off Wait until it's well critcled Once it's all crickled it will turn white If you fold it all the way then it will stick away It's still hard And there aren't any cracks So it's done You see as they're puffing up Sources of the heat should move so you got the waves But this is difficult Once you find that position Now you can do the same thing to the other side And check what it looks like That's right So you need to keep that center of gravity So that's one of the main secrets It's very important when you're popping them Yes, I don't want to speak now
Coach: So you mentioned earlier that you want to feel energized and be able to solve the issue, right?
