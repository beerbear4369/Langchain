User: Hello, I want to talk about my progress of building an AI chatbot.
Coach: So you say you want to talk about your progress on building an AI chatbot?
--------------------------------------------------
User: wow I would like to explore the you know like actually I'm not so sure about it
Coach: I'm not so sure about it. Okay. So what's important for you to explore on this topic?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel the progress. It's like when I zoom in, the whole day working on it, I feel it is fast, because the feedback is really in real time, so I can feel the progress. But I do feel that maybe I'm just rewinding the wheel, because sometimes it's like I'm not an expert in this, and I could be just making so many obvious mistakes, I don't know. It's like previously, the big jump from previous progress is that when I start to see the output of the code to the LLM, and I feel the format is somehow wrong. And just with identifying that issue, I can fix it. It will improve the performance quite a lot. And honestly saying, the effort before that could be stupid. We also tried many things, working with different models, and getting more data. So in that perspective, the progress is slow. For myself, it's like a learning journey. As far as I'm able to learn, I'm quite happy. I can feel the progress. But to the absolute scale, maybe it's actually progress quite slow.
Coach: So I heard you mentioned that you feel the progress, but you're not so sure about the absolute scale. If we zoom out, how would you define the progress on the absolute scale?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I would rate the progress of five, because I need to keep distracted from the other business. So it's not that fast, we haven't been able to build more team to work on it. The people I work with also do it like a set hassle, so once there is something more urgent, everyone will put this aside.
Coach: So you mentioned that you're kind of distracted from the other business, and that is affecting the progress. So if you are able to fully focus on the AI chatbot, how do you think that would impact the absolute scale?
