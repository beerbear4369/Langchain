User: Hello, how are you doing? What is your name?
Coach: I am doing well, and my name is Kuku.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Hello, Cucu. Very nice to meet you again. So I think today we can talk about our dog because he is so cute. I love him, but he's barking all the time, especially at night when he comes late. And he will have a strong voice to wake up the entire neighborhood. And sometimes we feel we don't know what to do.
Coach: So, it sounds like you want to talk about your dog and his barking.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, right. And by the way, my dog's name is Bear, let's call him Bear.
Coach: Okay. So you want to talk about Bear and his barking.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, correct.
Coach: So, how do you feel if Bear keeps barking?
--------------------------------------------------
User: 他需要更多节奏一点，然后比如说加入一些背景。就是要提高他的美感。OK, I think he should be barking in a more dynamic way, to bark nicely, don't be so loud, right? Because when he's barking, he's trying to express something. And I know what he's expressing, he's like, hey, you're coming back, why are you coming back so late? Feed me, feed me, I'm so hungry, I miss you so much. But sometimes, I mean, we really appreciate the love. This love is a bit overwhelming, it's like we wake up the entire neighborhood, right? I hope we can express it in a quieter way. Yeah, so it's like, especially when I come back from a business trip, it's become a hard situation for me. On one side, I don't want to discourage him from showing his love to me. On the other side, I also don't want him to bark so loudly, so the entire neighborhood comes and complains to us, like us, standing in this community.
Coach: So, you want Bear to express his love, but in a more elegant way, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Right
Coach: So, I'm curious, how did Bear's barking affect you and your family?
--------------------------------------------------
User: He didn't bark that much last time, but now after moving to this new neighborhood, so he's barking quite loudly and we did receive some complaints from other people. So I feel bad about that. I mean, I do think we're shooting this to other people. This is really not cool and sometimes we really come back pretty late. So that is really like we keep us up. So I think that is really bad. And yeah, I mean, if it don't disturb other people, I don't mind. Just bark, right? Just say, hey, let me love you, let me love you. Hey, I love you back, I love you back, I love you back. But we need to keep other people in mind as well.
Coach: So it sounds like you are concerned about the neighborhood and other people's sleep, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes.
Coach: So, how do you know if Bear is barking too loudly?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I can tell that because I have an ear and I am able to hear whether it's loud or not.
Coach: Okay. So, how would you rate Bear's barking on a scale of 1 to 10? 1 means too quiet, 10 means too loud.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess it's 10.
Coach: Okay. And how do you want Bear's barking to be?
--------------------------------------------------
User: There's got to be five.
Coach: Okay. So, if we know that Bear's barking is currently at 10 and you want it to be at 5, what is the gap?
--------------------------------------------------
User: He's really healthy and strong. So his voice is really loud. He's a big dog. And another gap is that we didn't train him. We just let him grow wildly. So he doesn't have that kind of strength. We didn't teach him. Maybe we should teach him. Last time I saw there are some videos about some device. When they hear the bark, the device is releasing some kind of electronic sound that only dogs can hear. So they get discomfort and they stop barking. I was thinking about maybe we use that. But like I said, I don't want that to become negative. So he's expressing his love, his care about people. He got discouraged and it's also not good. So I don't know what is the best way to achieve that. If he's able to talk, if he's able to understand, that's better. Like now after we go back home, we just run and plan to let him don't bark.
Coach: So it sounds like you really want to find a solution that won't discourage Bear from expressing his love, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, but I didn't feel that much after he said that. I think yes, we don't need to publish him from Express. Not only his love, his anger, I think he should have the freedom to express his own feeling. He's like an independent dog. We respect him and we don't want to force him to become someone else. Actually, we are kind of proud of it, that it's like a kid grow up confident without too much constraint. Like really freedom, right? So I really proud of it on one hand, but on the other hand, I think it's just affect our reputation in this community as well.
Coach: So it sounds like you are really torn between two sides. On one side, you want Bear to be himself, to express his feelings freely. But on the other side, you want to respect the community and other people's sleep, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, so that's not a very common thing to say. If there's no people at all, I will give him the freedom to express.
Coach: So what do you value more? Bear's freedom or the neighborhood's sleep?
--------------------------------------------------
User: First I'm asking what the value most, right? I value more of their freedom actually because I don't care any neighbor. I don't know them. But like I really need to respect other people, right? I don't know them. So like one should not compromise another. And also depends on how bad is the response, right? If we're really so annoying, they may poison our dog. That's also possible, right?
Coach: So it sounds like you really want to find a balance between Bear's freedom and the community's peace, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so I really want to find the balance of personal freedom.
Coach: So what do you think is the best way to find this balance?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think it's due to being able to let him control his behavior.
Coach: So how do you plan to teach Bear?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Was hast du?
Coach: I mean, how do you plan to teach Bear to control his barking?
--------------------------------------------------
User: OK, so I think maybe I should search online to see some videos about how to train them well. I believe there are some resources online to do that.
Coach: Okay. And how do you want to keep yourself accountable for this?
--------------------------------------------------
User: OK, so I think the way to make me comfortable is like today is too late, but tomorrow, right, when I got time, I will try to search for the video of that and spend around 30 minutes of time to research online to see what's the best way to do it. And then I will try to train better when I work with him, maybe. Just take action, bring this topic to the table and attempt to resolve the issue.
Coach: Sounds good. Just to check in, how do you feel now?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so basically, I guess, you know what do I feel? I feel, why do I just do this earlier, right? Shouldn't I just do this a lot again? We can stop the issue. Yeah, sometimes I feel it's how lazy I am, right? Like delaying to this simple action for almost one year and keeping this issue on. I think the reason is like I keep prioritizing other things and this is like, this is no work. This doesn't mean much things. It's just a small pain in the ass. So I just keep it in the lower priority of the list. So it's like forever never been done.
Coach: So what made you realize that this is an important thing to do?
