User: Hello, I want to talk about my progress of building an AI chatbot.
Coach: I want to talk about my progress on building an AI chatbot.
--------------------------------------------------
User: wow I would like to explore the you know like actually I'm not so sure about it
Coach: So you said you want to talk about the progress on your AI chatbot.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel the progress. It's like when I zoom in, the whole day working on it, I feel it is fast, because the feedback is really in real time, so I can feel the progress. But I do feel that maybe I'm just rewinding the wheel, because sometimes it's like I'm not an expert in this, and I could be just making so many obvious mistakes, I don't know. It's like previously, the big jump from previous progress is that when I start to see the output of the code to the LLM, and I feel the format is somehow wrong. And just with identifying that issue, I can fix it. It will improve the performance quite a lot. And honestly saying, the effort before that could be stupid. We also tried many things, working with different models, and getting more data. So in that perspective, the progress is slow. For myself, it's like a learning journey. As far as I'm able to learn, I'm quite happy. I can feel the progress. But to the absolute scale, maybe it's actually progress quite slow.
Coach: So you feel that the progress is fast on a daily basis because you get real-time feedback. But if you zoom out a bit, you feel that you might still be just rewinding the wheel, because sometimes you feel that you're not an expert in this. And maybe you're just making obvious mistakes that you don't know of. And you also mentioned that your previous progress, like the big jump, it's not just from the new things you did, but it's more of you identifying the previous issues and fixing them, which makes you feel that the previous effort might be a bit stupid. And overall, you feel that you're learning, and you're happy about that. But in the absolute scale, you feel that the progress might be a bit slow.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I would rate the progress of five, because I need to keep distracted from the other business. So it's not that fast, we haven't been able to build more team to work on it. The people I work with also do it like a set hassle, so once there is something more urgent, everyone will put this aside.
Coach: So if you rate the progress five, because you feel that you need to keep distracting from other businesses, and you haven't built a bigger team yet, and the people you're working with are also doing this as a side hassle, so it's not that fast.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess the fundamental reason is that we are doing this at part-time, so if you consider the progress versus the amount of energy and time you invest in, it's fast. But if you see the entire progress, I think it's slow. After one or two months, I started to think about this from last year, and I met my partner for the AI coaching assistant for more than a month, and from there to now, we haven't yet published the MVP, so it's not that fast, actually, if you consider it against a full-time team.
Coach: So you just mentioned that if you compare it to the full-time team, you feel that it's actually slow, because you started this journey since last year, and you met your partner for a month, and until now, you haven't published the MVP.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, if I can work full-time on this, it will definitely be faster because I'll be fully indulged in it, and I won't get distracted. You know, it's like sometimes, being distracted, getting back to this topic, I cannot find the files. I forget where I put those information, and it's taken me a while to get back, you know. There's like scientifically results that if you're shifting from topic, you need to mentally reconstruct to go back to the, I don't know how to describe, the stage, okay? And having a full-time team working on it, of course, is even better, but it's like even me as a founder is working part-time on this, right? So how could I get a full-time team working on it unless I take the lead to really step out of my business, which I don't look easy as of now, because like next week I need to go to Vietnam to meet some customers as well. Yeah, so it's really like a sad hustle project now.
Coach: Yeah, and you also mentioned that if you work full-time on this, it will be faster, because you will be fully indulged in this, and you won't get distracted. And sometimes, the distractions will also make it slower, because you need to get back to the state where you left off, and you also mentioned that it's not easy for you to just step out from your other businesses.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I will rate it as 5 and you have asked this question already.
Coach: Okay, so you rate it as 5 and you feel that you have answered this question already.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, that's a good question. I guess I would like to prioritize the AIChat project, the AIChatbot, because I'm really interested in doing it, but I'm saying this is much more uncertainty, right? I still need the cash flow, I still need money. So when there is a project from the other business, the construction business, I'll be more prioritized to doing that. But when there's no business, when there's basically a free time, the time that's available for me to decide on what to do, I'm actually fully dedicated to the AIChatbot. Right now, what I'm doing right now, yeah.
Coach: So you mentioned that you would like to fully dedicate to the AIChatbot project, but there is still uncertainty, so when there is a project from your other business, you will prioritize that. But when there is no other business, you are fully dedicated to the AIChatbot project.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess it's like 50-50 when in Singapore I have fully control of my time I do more on air transport but when I'm in Vietnam, when I'm on business trip, I'm mainly doing that business things yeah so I feel it's about 50-50 at the moment but sometimes the consulting business have a higher priority because that is earning cash right like AI business is more like interest and there's totally no cash flow at the moment it's just like a interest project so when there is a request from the main business, I will drop my progress for AI transport and doing the consulting business yeah so a good priority to that
Coach: So you feel that the consulting business has a higher priority because that is generating cash flow, while the AI business is more of an interest project and there is no cash flow yet.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, that's a good question. Ideally, I just like to do one meeting on Monday and all the necessary things finish on Monday. Then the rest six days on the AI chatbot project. Yeah, that's the ideal way. Then it would be like six out of seven. If we convert it by percentage, how much is the percentage?
Coach: So you mentioned that ideally, you would like to have one meeting on Monday and the rest of the time from Tuesday to Sunday, you will fully dedicate to the AI chatbot project. So that would be like six out of seven days.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so around 85%.
Coach: So around 85% of your time, you would like to be able to dedicate to the AI chatbot project.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't understand the question. Can you expand it?
Coach: Yeah, so you mentioned that you would like to fully dedicate to the AI chatbot project, but there are still distractions.
--------------------------------------------------
User: If I'm able to work 85% of the time, I think it goes much faster and it's much better continuity. Like keep iterating, release new features, and I'll be more in the mood to talk to everyone, to get results, to move things faster. Like move things faster, I think it's like a motivation, it's like make you feel it's moving forward and you become more active, like it's like a positive feedback loop and make it even better because it feels good, you work more, you see progress, and because you see progress, you work even more, it's like a rewarding loop. And if you work less, if progress is slow, then you'll be lazy to work because you don't see the real progress and there's no feedback, so this is like a punishment.
Coach: So you feel that if you can fully dedicate 85% of your time to the AI chatbot project, it will progress much faster, and there will be better continuity, which will also drive your motivation and positive feedback loop.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't understand
Coach: So if your progress is fast, you will be more motivated to work. But if the progress is slow, you will feel lazy to work because you don't see the progress.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I still don't understand, what would you mean, would you read, you mean to read my current progress and assume that I have spent 85% of the energy?
Coach: No, I mean that at the moment, because you are not able to fully dedicate to the AI chatbot project, you feel that it is progressing slowly, and that lack of progress is making you feel lazy for working on it.
--------------------------------------------------
User: If let's say the real physical progress is basically I, for example, I train three models these two days, right? If I spend 85% of the time, it would be too slow, I'm saying it would be too slow because basically I do only two days' work, it's like two days of work, diluting to maybe like six days, right? So it would be really slow.
Coach: So you're saying that if you fully dedicate 85% of your time, the progress would be faster than it is now.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Correct. You're wrong. I guess it's like a scale from zero to ten, right? So currently I'm rating it as five, I would say if I can work full time, it would be seven or eight, because I still think it would be too slow, you know?
Coach: So you feel that currently, because you are not fully dedicated, the progress is at a five. But if you are fully dedicated, it would be at a seven or eight, because you still think it is slow.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess it is the commitment that I have to contribute to my construction business, like things that I have to work on.
Coach: So the real distraction is your commitment to the consulting business.
