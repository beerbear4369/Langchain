User: Hello, my name is Ian, and I want to talk about my process of developing my AI chatbot.
Coach: So, Ian, you want to talk about developing your AI chatbot. How is that process going?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I mean, if there are some bugs or issues, the AI web coding will just try to create many new functions to solve it.
Coach: I see. So, is there a bug in the chatbot process that you'd like to discuss?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, maybe not on the specific part, but what is the best way to work with the current technology stack?
Coach: So, you want to discuss the best way to work with your current technology stack for your AI chatbot?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Exactly, just right
Coach: So, what specifically about working with your current technology stack would you like to discuss?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Maybe, like, how should I, like, for example, I think it's really about workflow, right? Like, what job should I do and what job should I let AI to do? How much should I trust AI to finish the job? So that is the strategic decision we need to make to design the workflow. Because on one hand, I could totally just leave it to AI to do everything, but it is like become out of control and become hard to maintain. On the other side, I feel if they keep human in the loop too much, human is actually slowing down the process because human takes longer time to read and respond. It's not as fast as the AI and not as smart from some perspective. But still, it's like, yeah, that's the reason.
Coach: So, it sounds like you want to talk about the balance of workflow between AI and human involvement in the AI chatbot process.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, correct. You are 100% correct.
Coach: So, Ian, how would you know that we have successfully addressed your question of AI and human balance in your chatbot process?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Like, if I can think about a really suitable workflow, potentially better workflow than the one I'm currently using at the moment, I think it's a great success at the end of the day.
Coach: And why is it important for you to find a successful workflow between AI and human interaction in your chatbot process?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess it's important because finding a successful workflow can so much faster the progress of the software development. And I guess that is the key, right? It's really about what is AI's role, what is human's role, how should we use AI to accomplish something? And that will decide on, that will really impact the entire success of the project. Because AI is also not perfect, sometimes it's come up with some garbage code and it's also annoying. So it's really good to know to what extent should we use it and where is the control point, where should we check and make sure everything sounds, you know?
Coach: So, Ian, how are you currently balancing AI and human interaction in your chatbot development process?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Currently, I'm like a real powerful AI, like deep research model to search for technical stack and come up with strategy and then evaluate this strategy and then think about it and then further do some further questioning and then decide one of the proposals. So it's like AI is like the expert, I'm like the manager, so I decide what is the way to go. Then I tell this decision to the AI developer, the cursor. Then the cursor will implement this strategy. After implementation, I will ask it to do something, to try, to test, but I also will try and test. But sometimes I'm able to finish it in one shot if you create some new issue that no one can expect. And then when I'm trying to resolve the issue, it may overkill, right, rather than solve it directly. That is the issue I'm seeing.
Coach: So, it sounds like you are in a manager role, guiding the AI and overseeing the process.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, and also like tester role. On one side I'm doing a manager role to set up a big direction. I ask it to propose how to design the system. Then I evaluate the result, work with it to some key questions. Then I decide on the direction. After that I become a tester when it comes to the implementation. To just test, see if there's any bug. If there is some bug, normally I also cannot solve it. I just report to it, report to AI about the bug and then hope it can solve it. So not only reporter, it's like I also become its tester, like work for the AI as well.
Coach: So, Ian, you mentioned that you are sometimes unable to solve the bugs in your chatbot process. What do you think is the cause of that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think one of the potential causes is that I'm not so good, you know? So I would like AI to do as much as it can, but sometimes the way AI is used is not so ideal. Like AI likes to create new more code, more functions to solve the bugs. But when you create more functions, it's also likely you introduce some new bugs. So the methodology and idea is different. If I'm the one doing it, I would just try to do a minimal change to maintain the code base. But AI will really add in a lot of functions and create many new things to do that. Sometimes they do it correct and I really learn a lot from it. Like it's come up with the test script to try out the code and it's really efficient. It's much better than my own human tester.
Coach: I see. So, it sounds like one of the challenges in the process is that the AI's approach to solving bugs is different from your own, which may lead to new bugs in the system.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, we need to do bags and also need to be out of control.
Coach: So, Ian, you mentioned that your role is a tester and a manager in the process. Are there any specific areas that you think you should change in your own role to better balance the workflow between AI and human interaction?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess the manager is quite good, it's like setting up the right direction, rather than nothing, just a way up. It's quite good to me, right? So, and I see that flow is working well. But on the tester side, yeah, I mean, it's like if you take as your staff, right, they have their own idea. So, if I think in that way, I would feel, definitely we have really good staff, really talented at creating new code. It's like how to interrupt this stuff. On one hand, I actually shouldn't micromanage him to do in the exact way that I like, right? That's not good. And also not effective because I should believe that the staff know the best in that particular area than me because he's the one doing it. I'm not the one doing it, right? It's like as a developer that is writing the code, so he knows the best of it, not me. And on the other side, it's like if you just let the staff do the things on his own, right, in the way he likes, it is also not so good sometimes. So, I should give him some feedback about what is the better behavior so he can perform accordingly. And I think I should put it into the rules, into the MCP rules, so it will try to obey that. It's actually much easier than working with a human being.
Coach: So, Ian, it sounds like you may need to give the AI some specific rules and guidelines to follow in its coding process to better align with your own style.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Right, as in just the action to move forward?
Coach: So, what are some specific actions you think you can take to better balance the workflow between AI and human interaction in your chatbot process?
--------------------------------------------------
User: OK, I think number one is that I can immediately add some new rules to the AI developer, right? So it's able to follow my own style. Second is that I could research what is the ideal workflow that people are using to develop things, right? To learn from them. Actually I thought about that but I didn't do it. It's because when I'm doing that, it means I need to stop the developing work that I'm currently doing. So it's always like the choice between to sharpen your knife or to use the knife now to kill the animal. So if you keep sharpening your knife, your things never move forward. If you never sharpen your knife, you're just like doing slow. So it is the balance to take. Actually I'm thinking to research about that and try that new workflow in the new project or next phase of this development. But just using the existing workflow to finish it first.
Coach: I see. So, to summarize, you feel that one action you could take is to immediately set some rules and guidelines for the AI developer to follow in its coding process. And a second action you are considering is to research effective workflows that others are using in AI development.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Correct, you're right.
Coach: So, Ian, how do you feel about the actions you have identified to take?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel it's actually quite easy step to take, just consuming 5 minutes, 10 minutes, but I'm not taking it, right? What is that reason? What is the things holding me back? Like, you know, it's really hard for humans to understand himself and human is never a reasonable person. So, yeah, I think it's worth some time to discovering that perspective, like why actually I have thought about it and I know I should do it, but I just didn't do that, right? It's not only for this case, also for many other cases in my life. It's just simple things, only take 30 minutes of time, but you are just trying to delay it and forever delay it, not to take action to do it. It's not really a strange behavior for all the human beings, you know?
Coach: I see. So, to help you understand your own behavior and thinking, are there any specific questions you would like to ask yourself?
--------------------------------------------------
User: If I want to ask myself, like, why I didn't take action. Well, I know I obviously took the action immediately to change the situation. Why you don't take action? I guess one reason is that the roadmap is not completely clear and you don't know what's the immediate step, one, two, three. You know, like, you know what to do, but you don't know exactly how to do it, so you just didn't do that. But actually your first step should be research on what is the way to do that, to get to know how to do that so you can do it. But I think sometimes people just missing this step. Second reason I think is fear of fail, right? They're afraid they try and then they fail and they have nowhere to find the skills to bounce back. I think that should be one of the reasons as well.
Coach: So, Ian, how does your understanding of yourself influence the actions you take?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I know some fundamental psychology behind what is holding me back, but that doesn't mean I can overcome it. It's like you know the root cause of a disease, but that doesn't mean you can heal it. You still behave in that way. You still didn't take action where you should take because the fear is still there and you cannot make it disappear, right?
Coach: So, Ian, given that you still have this fear, what do you think you can do to help yourself take action in your AI chatbot development process?
--------------------------------------------------
User: A really good question. You're passing it back, right? So let's stick with the goal. I think one of the things is just to set a tight deadline for those actions to be taken. It will force you to just take the action because you can only do that. And even though you know that is giving a rubbish job, you know there's no way to run away from it, so you can only do it directly. And once you do it, actually it's not that fearful, right? It's like lying to yourself that, oh, you must get it done tomorrow. Actually, you know that you can delay for maybe another 10 days, it doesn't matter. So it may be hard to implement. What else I can do is like... I think other things is like what I haven't done is like just set the timeline, right? Just set this is the scope, this is what I want to do, I really want to wrap it up, and then fuck everything else, and then just move on and see how it goes, right? Rather than keep developing, keep fun tuning, keep optimizing what might not be necessary. You know when you evaluate your own work, when we evaluate other people's work, we're in a totally different mode. Yeah, that is what I observe. Like I know that sometimes people are just spending their precious time on totally useless things. I know that I can identify them, I can instruct them to not to do, but I come to myself, I do the same thing. I also do something really useless. And yeah, so strange is that.
Coach: So, Ian, you mentioned that one thing you could do is to set a tight deadline for yourself to take action. And a second thing you could do is to set a specific timeline and scope for your research and evaluation of the workflow and to stick to that.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, set a timeline, force it to take action, not to set a specific timeline to research and evaluate a workflow. I mean like, not only the workflow, now I'm talking about a more general case.
Coach: What do you think is the specific action you need to take to help you set deadlines and timelines for your research and workflow?
--------------------------------------------------
User: That's a really good question. The specific action is to add this as a task and to evaluate the things inside the deadline for all the tasks in my to-do list. I think adding this action specifically into the to-do list is also the important first step. So that there is something to force me to do it and then to bound me through a certain scope, certain action. Yeah, I think I can try this out immediately.
Coach: I think you are already very good at setting deadlines and timelines and you have a good awareness of the importance of that.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I'm so proud of you.
Coach: May I ask what is the specific deadline for your action of putting the timeline into your to-do list?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, it's like after I finish this round of updating the product, I will do that this afternoon. But one thing I observe is like finishing this product for tuning is taking longer time because it have new things and functions coming out and the list is never finished. The list is more things is going to list, then the speed of this is getting done, right? Like imagine like someone is filling the list, someone is also killing the list, so I'm the one who is filling the list and also killing the list. So I observe more issues, I'm adding more things to the list, but I also like that speed is faster than the resolving part. So if I split these two rooms, yeah, it's like I have been giving myself too many jobs to do, you know, and to do that finding new problem and then solving the problem.
Coach: So Ian, to summarize, you said you will put the action of setting a deadline for your research into your to-do list by this afternoon.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, you're right. Shall we wrap up this session?
Coach: Would you like to add anything before we end the session?
--------------------------------------------------
User: It is a bit superficial, I didn't go to that direction.
Coach: So Ian, I really appreciate your time today. Thank you very much.
