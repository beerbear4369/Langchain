User: Hello, this is Ian. How are you?
Coach: Kuku, it's great to see you again.
--------------------------------------------------
User: 我叫Ian。
Coach: So, Ian, what would you like to discuss today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so basically I want to discuss about one of the project failure that I recently encountered.
Coach: You said a project failure recently encountered. Can you elaborate a bit more? What happened there?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so basically, you know, it's like we're supposed to do a mockup. Like, all of a sudden, there's a really big program come out from nowhere from Vietnam. And they are correctly using our product, the product that we tried to put into the market. And we received this from both my sales and my founder. We found out the mockup. But then I'm thinking, like, the test is not because they don't really ask for this. So I think they tested in a really wrong way. And it shows that our result is negative, you know.
Coach: So, how do you feel about this failure?
--------------------------------------------------
User: because this is really a big project and my willingness to witness this is like 10 times bigger than a normal project. If I just do that color there, the result might be totally different. So what can I do?
Coach: So, you're saying that if you just change the color, it may lead to a different result.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, because they said they want a blue color, and they are testing a lot of color change. It could also be checked, three competitors, including us, go to do the mockup. And one using green. I think they are totally wrong. They shouldn't do this result, this color. We are doing the right one. And we know that this blue color is more subject to the color change. But still, customers just assess directly, and then think the green one is the best, which is a mistake. They assessed it wrongly. But now we move back around.
Coach: So, what do you think you can do to address this issue?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't think I can really address that issue. Like, I have even asked my team to help them with the situation. But still they don't listen. Like, oh, we already confirmed blah blah blah, and we're trying to close us. So, well, I guess all I can do now, I can nothing of anything else to do, but let it happen, let it figure it happen, let them also talk to other people, let us lose the deal. Really, so sad.
Coach: So, you mentioned that all you can do is to let it happen. How does that help you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: How does that help me? It doesn't help me much. I mean, there's nothing I can do basically, so what do you suggest?
Coach: I didn't say anything. I just asked how that helps you.
--------------------------------------------------
User: That doesn't help me much, especially it is out of my control, right?
Coach: So, if it's out of your control, then what do you think you can do?
--------------------------------------------------
User: What do you mean? It is out of my control already. Nothing I can do.
Coach: So, if it's out of your control, then what do you think you can do?
--------------------------------------------------
User: But do you suggest?
Coach: I'm not suggesting. I'm just asking.
--------------------------------------------------
User: OK, so what is the question?
Coach: So, you mentioned that since it's out of your control, then there's nothing you can do.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, as I mentioned, it is out of my control, there's nothing I can do. The most is to call my subcontractor and tell him about the news, and see if he's still able to proceed with the project, and use my material for the substrate, maybe? Like asking him to reject this idea? Like asking him to buy other people's material to use, or just let go of the project?
Coach: So, are you saying that you can at least try something?
--------------------------------------------------
User: have made effort to make the main call, talk to customer representative and meet there. And I even tried to find a way to get their boss and correct how to get customer's management, but all have failed because it has been decided
Coach: So, you mentioned that you have done a lot of effort, but do you think the outcome is what you want?
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, the outcome is not what I want.
Coach: So, what do you really want?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I wanted to be able to fucking win the project, okay?
Coach: So, you really want to win the project.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, of course I want to be in the picture.
Coach: And what does that mean to you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: It means a great success, a real big project finally.
Coach: So, you mentioned that it means a big success to you. Can you tell me more about the meaning of success?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Meaning of success is like I asked him so stupid question. I really don't understand. Success means a lot to me, okay? Success means we're able to earn money from that marketing, able to prove that our previous decision is correct, there is the authenticity there, and we can be happy because it's a project for the company there. We just need to set up the profit. Like project this scale is really hard to get. It's like a key moment. And I just feel that I still tend to really thinking when it comes to key moments.
Coach: You mentioned that the success of this project means a lot to you.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Larmi
Coach: And how does that relate to your feeling of letdown?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, because it means a lot. I think that can explain my sadness.
Coach: So, what is the real reason for your sadness?
--------------------------------------------------
User: The real reason is just that we lose. I put a big coat on it, but then it was right because I made some mistakes. So, of course it was that. But it's also okay. It's not the first time I get used to it, so it's okay. And we just do what we can control. If we're doing these many things out of control, so you just let it go.
Coach: So, you mentioned that what you can control is to talk to your subcontractor.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I also cannot control myself.
Coach: What does that mean?
--------------------------------------------------
User: That means I can only control myself.
Coach: So, you said what you can control is to talk to your subcontractor.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Ja, es tut mir sehr.
Coach: And how does that make you feel?
--------------------------------------------------
User: It's like the last thing you can do, right?
Coach: So, you mentioned that you can only control yourself. What does that mean to you?
--------------------------------------------------
