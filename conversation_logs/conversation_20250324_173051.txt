User: Hello, I want to talk about my progress of building an AI chatbot.
Coach: Sure, can we take a moment to set a goal for our conversation?
--------------------------------------------------
User: wow I would like to explore the you know like actually I'm not so sure about it
Coach: Yes, I mean you mentioned earlier that there are some challenges that you've been facing recently in building the chatbot.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel the progress. It's like when I zoom in, the whole day working on it, I feel it is fast, because the feedback is really in real time, so I can feel the progress. But I do feel that maybe I'm just rewinding the wheel, because sometimes it's like I'm not an expert in this, and I could be just making so many obvious mistakes, I don't know. It's like previously, the big jump from previous progress is that when I start to see the output of the code to the LLM, and I feel the format is somehow wrong. And just with identifying that issue, I can fix it. It will improve the performance quite a lot. And honestly saying, the effort before that could be stupid. We also tried many things, working with different models, and getting more data. So in that perspective, the progress is slow. For myself, it's like a learning journey. As far as I'm able to learn, I'm quite happy. I can feel the progress. But to the absolute scale, maybe it's actually progress quite slow.
Coach: Wow, I really love how you're measuring the progress. I mean, you mentioned on one hand, you're looking at a zoomed in view, where you can see the progress every day, because the feedback is so immediate. But then sometimes you zoom out and then you feel, am I just redoing things that are already done? And then you mentioned, you know, at times, you feel that you could be just making obvious mistakes, and that is slowing down the progress. And that perspective, you're feeling the progress is quite slow. But on the other hand, you also mentioned that, you know, as long as you're learning, and as long as you can feel that you're getting better, you are happy with the progress. So just curious, I mean, you mentioned these two perspectives. So what is the impact on you? I mean, how do you feel about the progress?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I would rate the progress of five, because I need to keep distracted from the other business. So it's not that fast, we haven't been able to build more team to work on it. The people I work with also do it like a set hassle, so once there is something more urgent, everyone will put this aside.
Coach: So if the distraction is not there, how do you think the progress would be?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess the fundamental reason is that we are doing this at part-time, so if you consider the progress versus the amount of energy and time you invest in, it's fast. But if you see the entire progress, I think it's slow. After one or two months, I started to think about this from last year, and I met my partner for the AI coaching assistant for more than a month, and from there to now, we haven't yet published the MVP, so it's not that fast, actually, if you consider it against a full-time team.
Coach: So it sounds like, you know, the speed of progress is very much related to the amount of time you could invest. But if I step back and look at the bigger picture, the progress feels slow. And I'm just curious, you mentioned you're happy with the learning aspect. If you look at the bigger picture, how would you define success in terms of the learning?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, if I can work full-time on this, it will definitely be faster because I'll be fully indulged in it, and I won't get distracted. You know, it's like sometimes, being distracted, getting back to this topic, I cannot find the files. I forget where I put those information, and it's taken me a while to get back, you know. There's like scientifically results that if you're shifting from topic, you need to mentally reconstruct to go back to the, I don't know how to describe, the stage, okay? And having a full-time team working on it, of course, is even better, but it's like even me as a founder is working part-time on this, right? So how could I get a full-time team working on it unless I take the lead to really step out of my business, which I don't look easy as of now, because like next week I need to go to Vietnam to meet some customers as well. Yeah, so it's really like a sad hustle project now.
Coach: And it sounds like the distraction from the other business is one of the key factors that's limiting the speed of the progress.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I will rate it as 5 and you have asked this question already.
Coach: So how about if there's no distraction, how fast do you think the progress would be?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, that's a good question. I guess I would like to prioritize the AIChat project, the AIChatbot, because I'm really interested in doing it, but I'm saying this is much more uncertainty, right? I still need the cash flow, I still need money. So when there is a project from the other business, the construction business, I'll be more prioritized to doing that. But when there's no business, when there's basically a free time, the time that's available for me to decide on what to do, I'm actually fully dedicated to the AIChatbot. Right now, what I'm doing right now, yeah.
Coach: So if I look at the distraction from the other business, it's more of a financial consideration rather than a time availability consideration.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess it's like 50-50 when in Singapore I have fully control of my time I do more on air transport but when I'm in Vietnam, when I'm on business trip, I'm mainly doing that business things yeah so I feel it's about 50-50 at the moment but sometimes the consulting business have a higher priority because that is earning cash right like AI business is more like interest and there's totally no cash flow at the moment it's just like a interest project so when there is a request from the main business, I will drop my progress for AI transport and doing the consulting business yeah so a good priority to that
Coach: So if we look at the speed of the progress, it sounds like the distraction from the other business is one of the key factors that's limiting the speed of the progress.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, that's a good question. Ideally, I just like to do one meeting on Monday and all the necessary things finish on Monday. Then the rest six days on the AI chatbot project. Yeah, that's the ideal way. Then it would be like six out of seven. If we convert it by percentage, how much is the percentage?
Coach: Yeah, about 85% on AI chatbot project and 15% on consulting project.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so around 85%.
Coach: So if we look at the ideal state of 85% on the AI chatbot project and 15% on the other business distraction, how would you rate the speed of the progress now?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't understand the question. Can you expand it?
Coach: So if the ideal state is that you're fully focused on the AI chatbot project 85% of the time, and the other business distraction is only 15%, how would you rate the speed of the progress now?
--------------------------------------------------
User: If I'm able to work 85% of the time, I think it goes much faster and it's much better continuity. Like keep iterating, release new features, and I'll be more in the mood to talk to everyone, to get results, to move things faster. Like move things faster, I think it's like a motivation, it's like make you feel it's moving forward and you become more active, like it's like a positive feedback loop and make it even better because it feels good, you work more, you see progress, and because you see progress, you work even more, it's like a rewarding loop. And if you work less, if progress is slow, then you'll be lazy to work because you don't see the real progress and there's no feedback, so this is like a punishment.
Coach: So if we look at this positive feedback loop, how would you rate the speed of the progress now?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't understand
Coach: So if you rate the speed of the progress now, let's say if you rate the ideal state as 10, and the other business distraction as 0, how would you rate the speed of the progress now?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I still don't understand, what would you mean, would you read, you mean to read my current progress and assume that I have spent 85% of the energy?
Coach: No, I'm asking the current situation, if the ideal state is 85% on the AI chatbot project, how would you rate the speed of the progress now?
--------------------------------------------------
User: If let's say the real physical progress is basically I, for example, I train three models these two days, right? If I spend 85% of the time, it would be too slow, I'm saying it would be too slow because basically I do only two days' work, it's like two days of work, diluting to maybe like six days, right? So it would be really slow.
Coach: So if you look at the speed of the progress, it's more like two days of work.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Correct. You're wrong. I guess it's like a scale from zero to ten, right? So currently I'm rating it as five, I would say if I can work full time, it would be seven or eight, because I still think it would be too slow, you know?
Coach: So you rate the current state as five, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess it is the commitment that I have to contribute to my construction business, like things that I have to work on.
Coach: So the commitment to the consulting business is one of the key factors that limit the speed of the progress.
