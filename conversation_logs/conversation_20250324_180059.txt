User: Hello, this is Ian. How are you?
Coach: I'm fine. And you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: 我叫Ian。
Coach: Okay. It's 10 o'clock now, and I know we only have half an hour...
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so basically I want to discuss about one of the project failure that I recently encountered.
Coach: Okay. How do you feel about it?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so basically, you know, it's like we're supposed to do a mockup. Like, all of a sudden, there's a really big program come out from nowhere from Vietnam. And they are correctly using our product, the product that we tried to put into the market. And we received this from both my sales and my founder. We found out the mockup. But then I'm thinking, like, the test is not because they don't really ask for this. So I think they tested in a really wrong way. And it shows that our result is negative, you know.
Coach: So Ian, earlier you mentioned that you want to discuss about the project failure. But now, you keep saying, you know, they did it in a wrong way. And there's something that, you know, there's a feeling that there's something external, you know, that you didn't really get to the root cause of the failure. Is that right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: because this is really a big project and my willingness to witness this is like 10 times bigger than a normal project. If I just do that color there, the result might be totally different. So what can I do?
Coach: So I hear from you that, you know, this is a big project, 10 times bigger than others. And if it's just a small thing, you know, it might be different. So I think there's something that you really want to get to the bottom of it. Is that right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, because they said they want a blue color, and they are testing a lot of color change. It could also be checked, three competitors, including us, go to do the mockup. And one using green. I think they are totally wrong. They shouldn't do this result, this color. We are doing the right one. And we know that this blue color is more subject to the color change. But still, customers just assess directly, and then think the green one is the best, which is a mistake. They assessed it wrongly. But now we move back around.
Coach: So Ian, I hear that, you know, you keep saying they are doing it wrongly. They are doing the mockup wrongly, the test wrongly. But what I want to ask is, what could we have done differently to, you know, change the outcome?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't think I can really address that issue. Like, I have even asked my team to help them with the situation. But still they don't listen. Like, oh, we already confirmed blah blah blah, and we're trying to close us. So, well, I guess all I can do now, I can nothing of anything else to do, but let it happen, let it figure it happen, let them also talk to other people, let us lose the deal. Really, so sad.
Coach: So I hear that, you know, you keep saying, I can't do anything, I cannot do anything, you know, I cannot, don't know what to do. But what if you kind of remove the external factor, you know, if you can do anything, what would you do?
--------------------------------------------------
User: How does that help me? It doesn't help me much. I mean, there's nothing I can do basically, so what do you suggest?
Coach: So you said, there's nothing I can do. And you also said earlier, you know, you tried to reach out to the team, but the team is not listening, they're not responsive.
--------------------------------------------------
User: That doesn't help me much, especially it is out of my control, right?
Coach: I understand that, you know, the outcome is out of your control. But if we think of, you know, what if, if you can do anything, what would you do?
--------------------------------------------------
User: What do you mean? It is out of my control already. Nothing I can do.
Coach: I think something is bothering you. I can see it, you know, on your face.
--------------------------------------------------
User: But do you suggest?
Coach: I think, you know, you can do something, you know, it might not be directly about the project, but something you can do, you know, to help you with this feeling.
--------------------------------------------------
User: OK, so what is the question?
Coach: So what, you know, what could you do?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, as I mentioned, it is out of my control, there's nothing I can do. The most is to call my subcontractor and tell him about the news, and see if he's still able to proceed with the project, and use my material for the substrate, maybe? Like asking him to reject this idea? Like asking him to buy other people's material to use, or just let go of the project?
Coach: Yeah, I think this is a very big project, 10 times bigger than the others. And I think, you know, doing something, even just a small thing, might help you, you know, even though it might be out of your control.
--------------------------------------------------
User: have made effort to make the main call, talk to customer representative and meet there. And I even tried to find a way to get their boss and correct how to get customer's management, but all have failed because it has been decided
Coach: Yeah, I can see there's something that you really want to do.
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, the outcome is not what I want.
Coach: Yeah, but I think it's important to take an action, you know, to do something.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I wanted to be able to fucking win the project, okay?
Coach: Yeah, but you know, that might be a big thing. But I think, you know, even just a small thing, it might help you relieve some of this feeling.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, of course I want to be in the picture.
Coach: And you said earlier, you know, you don't want to be a loser.
--------------------------------------------------
User: It means a great success, a real big project finally.
Coach: But again, you know, even just a small thing, maybe just a call to the subcontractor, you know, just something.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Meaning of success is like I asked him so stupid question. I really don't understand. Success means a lot to me, okay? Success means we're able to earn money from that marketing, able to prove that our previous decision is correct, there is the authenticity there, and we can be happy because it's a project for the company there. We just need to set up the profit. Like project this scale is really hard to get. It's like a key moment. And I just feel that I still tend to really thinking when it comes to key moments.
Coach: I think this is something you really want to get to the bottom of.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Larmi
Coach: Let me summarize to make sure I understand correctly. So you said, you know, success means a lot to you. And this project is very important for the company, for the team. And you really want to win this project. And even just a small thing, you know, maybe like a call to the subcontractor, you know, to ask him to do something, even just a small thing, might help you.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, because it means a lot. I think that can explain my sadness.
Coach: Then what would be your next step?
