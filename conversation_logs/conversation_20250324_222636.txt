User: Hello, this is Ian. How are you?
Coach: Hi Ian, I'm good. How are you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: 我叫Ian。
Coach: Do you have something specific you want to talk about today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so basically I want to discuss about one of the project failure that I recently encountered.
Coach: One of the project failure?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so basically, you know, it's like we're supposed to do a mockup. Like, all of a sudden, there's a really big program come out from nowhere from Vietnam. And they are correctly using our product, the product that we tried to put into the market. And we received this from both my sales and my founder. We found out the mockup. But then I'm thinking, like, the test is not because they don't really ask for this. So I think they tested in a really wrong way. And it shows that our result is negative, you know.
Coach: So, Ian, if I were to summarize what you just said, it seems like the reason for the project failure was due to the testing process that was carried out.
--------------------------------------------------
User: because this is really a big project and my willingness to witness this is like 10 times bigger than a normal project. If I just do that color there, the result might be totally different. So what can I do?
Coach: So, just to summarize again, it sounds like you really want to dive deeper into this issue because the stakes are really high.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, because they said they want a blue color, and they are testing a lot of color change. It could also be checked, three competitors, including us, go to do the mockup. And one using green. I think they are totally wrong. They shouldn't do this result, this color. We are doing the right one. And we know that this blue color is more subject to the color change. But still, customers just assess directly, and then think the green one is the best, which is a mistake. They assessed it wrongly. But now we move back around.
Coach: So it sounds like the main issue, as you said, is that the customers are assessing this wrongly.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't think I can really address that issue. Like, I have even asked my team to help them with the situation. But still they don't listen. Like, oh, we already confirmed blah blah blah, and we're trying to close us. So, well, I guess all I can do now, I can nothing of anything else to do, but let it happen, let it figure it happen, let them also talk to other people, let us lose the deal. Really, so sad.
Coach: So, Ian, you're saying that the real issue here, the real problem, is that you can't influence the customer to change their decision.
--------------------------------------------------
User: How does that help me? It doesn't help me much. I mean, there's nothing I can do basically, so what do you suggest?
Coach: So, as a coach, I know that you have encountered many challenges before. I remember you mentioning a few months ago that you had a really big challenge that you were trying to solve.
--------------------------------------------------
User: That doesn't help me much, especially it is out of my control, right?
Coach: Yeah, I mean, I remember in the past, you mentioned a few really difficult problems.
--------------------------------------------------
User: What do you mean? It is out of my control already. Nothing I can do.
Coach: Yeah, so it sounds like this situation is really different because you feel like you really can't do anything at all.
--------------------------------------------------
User: But do you suggest?
Coach: So, this project, if I understand correctly, the stakes are really high for you and for the company.
--------------------------------------------------
User: OK, so what is the question?
Coach: I don't know. What are you thinking?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, as I mentioned, it is out of my control, there's nothing I can do. The most is to call my subcontractor and tell him about the news, and see if he's still able to proceed with the project, and use my material for the substrate, maybe? Like asking him to reject this idea? Like asking him to buy other people's material to use, or just let go of the project?
Coach: So, if I were to summarize, it sounds like your main action here is to call your subcontractor and inform him about the situation.
--------------------------------------------------
User: have made effort to make the main call, talk to customer representative and meet there. And I even tried to find a way to get their boss and correct how to get customer's management, but all have failed because it has been decided
Coach: So, you've already tried a lot of things, and it sounds like this call with the subcontractor is just for you to feel more comfortable with the situation?
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, the outcome is not what I want.
Coach: Yeah, but the outcome is what you want, right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I wanted to be able to fucking win the project, okay?
Coach: So, just to summarize, it sounds like the outcome you want is for the project to be won.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, of course I want to be in the picture.
Coach: Yeah. So, this call with the subcontractor would help you move towards that outcome?
--------------------------------------------------
User: It means a great success, a real big project finally.
Coach: So, this call with the subcontractor would help you move towards that outcome?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Meaning of success is like I asked him so stupid question. I really don't understand. Success means a lot to me, okay? Success means we're able to earn money from that marketing, able to prove that our previous decision is correct, there is the authenticity there, and we can be happy because it's a project for the company there. We just need to set up the profit. Like project this scale is really hard to get. It's like a key moment. And I just feel that I still tend to really thinking when it comes to key moments.
Coach: So, this project is really important to you. And that outcome of the call, how does that help you towards winning the project?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Larmi
Coach: So, it sounds like the call with the subcontractor is really not going to help you towards winning the project.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, because it means a lot. I think that can explain my sadness.
Coach: So, if we come back to the main issue, how to influence the customer to change their decision, what do you think you can do?
--------------------------------------------------
User: The real reason is just that we lose. I put a big coat on it, but then it was right because I made some mistakes. So, of course it was that. But it's also okay. It's not the first time I get used to it, so it's okay. And we just do what we can control. If we're doing these many things out of control, so you just let it go.
Coach: So, if I hear you correctly, even though this project is really important to you, it still sounds like you are okay with the outcome.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I also cannot control myself.
Coach: So, if I hear you correctly, it sounds like the real issue here is that you are sad.
--------------------------------------------------
User: That means I can only control myself.
Coach: So, how do you deal with your sadness?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Ja, es tut mir sehr.
Coach: So, it sounds like one thing that helps you is to acknowledge your feelings.
