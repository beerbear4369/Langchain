User: Hello, my name is Ian and I'm testing you.
Coach: Kuku, I am a Kuku coach and I have a process that I use. Are you okay with that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: What is the process?
Coach: I normally have a 30-minute conversation with the person I'm coaching. Would you like to see how that works?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Siyal
Coach: I normally start with a goal and a topic. With whom are you speaking?
--------------------------------------------------
User: With whom are you speaking?
Coach: Sorry?
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, I don't understand your question. Can you repeat?
Coach: Okay, Ian, I'm speaking with Ian. From where?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't really understand.
Coach: Okay, Kuku, I don't have a lot of time, but I just wanted to let you know that I'm here in the (inaudible) team.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I don't know what you're talking about. So let's get started, what do you want to talk about today?
Coach: What are you doing?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I'm just adding one more function to my AI chatbot and see how does it work.
Coach: Okay, so you're just testing out your AI?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Testing out my AI
Coach: Okay, and how important is that for you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, it's really important for me. So it's a really brilliant idea. And you know, it's easy to get 80% build, like having an audio kind of conversation, make it really impressive to me in the day that I got it. But then after that, just adding some small features like how to ramp up this conversation, become really hard.
Coach: Okay, and what are you finding is the challenge in that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: The challenging is that you can make great progress really fast, like in one day. But then to make the fine tuning, the small progress is really slow, maybe in ten days.
Coach: Okay, and what would you like to have happen around that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, rapap?
Coach: Sorry, I didn't get that.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, let's continue the conversation.
Coach: Okay, so you're finding the fine tuning is taking longer than you would like.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, I think it will take longer to have the wrap-up function.
Coach: Okay, and if you think about those two different time frames, how does that impact you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: How does that impact me? I think it's like, I guess I see the really fast progress of building the main block, I'm really super confident in doing it, and like, oh, I'm also able to create great products and change the world, so I become really confident. But when this becomes slower, especially just to debug some simple things, right? It's like take me maybe few not as confident as I thought I would be. So for example, I say that I will just launch the MVP in two weeks' time, but unfortunately I feel that maybe I cannot deliver it because I say we'll finish this two small functions in two days, but in the end of the day it becomes longer. It becomes like I think almost four days to finish two simple functionalities. So it's kind of demotivating me.
Coach: Okay, so the longer time frame is impacting your confidence and your motivation.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yep.
Coach: Okay, and if you think about those two different time frames, how do you want to hold both of those?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't know, maybe how to have both of them is like, since the end of the whiteboard is due to the nature of the developer. Actually for many things in life in this world, it's actually easier to finish the 99%, but the final 1% is really painful. It's really taking a lot of time and effort to make it perfect. I guess that is the difference, right? Set apart a great product with a lousy product. So it's all this detail and all this effort that is taking a lot of time. And many times people also don't see those last final miles. They see the big picture in my record, you know. Yeah, that's it.
Coach: Yeah, so I guess how to balance is I need to tell myself that it's okay to take time. It's okay to have the slow progress. And it's also okay that maybe I don't need to finish every single small function. It's okay to make a compromise. As long as the big picture and the main functionality is working, it's good enough.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't know.
Coach: So what do you need to do to help yourself with that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess this way should, for example, I didn't do this coding seriously, so it's just like a small test out, right? So I guess it's the, it's like you need to face this reality that currently this is the progress and it is just easy to one shot give you a big bug building, but it's taking a really long time to finish the detail. So to adjust my expectation and it's already much better than last time, so don't complain so much, just hang there, do these tedious things to solve the bugs one by one. Like, yeah, it's really take blind tier to build the app, right? So that's it.
Coach: So it sounds like your action step is to notice when you start to feel demotivated or lose confidence and remind yourself that the slower progress is okay, is that right?
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, progress is okay, but it's like it is not slow progress. It appears to be slow to the outsider, to the layman, but it's actually the right pace. We have to play with that reality.
Coach: Okay, so the right pace.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think we have explored quite enough today.
Coach: So do you have any final thoughts or reflections before we wrap up?
--------------------------------------------------
