Coach: Let's start from the beginning. What would you like to explore today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I guess maybe we could talk about my work. You know, I have been doing this AI startup as a part-time base, just to commit a lot of time to it, and my main job, the foreign business, I basically put it aside. We can talk about it.
Coach: I hear you have two work paths—the AI startup and your main job. What part of this situation do you want to explore further?
--------------------------------------------------
User: A part of the situation that I want to explore further is that, well, I honestly don't know this AI startup is real. It's like, if you see my day to day, right? I just wake up at any time in life, sometimes in the afternoon, then go to my laptop and start coding to develop this AI coaching bot. Yeah, and I do it at night. And actually, I really don't like to do it. So I always delay that process, trying to do something only when I have to do. I don't really like it. So the AI thing is like my escape from the reality of this flow business, you know? But the AI thing also could be funny because it's like maybe what I do is like it's a joke, you know? Maybe what takes me a month, other people could just finish in a day because I'm also I just do everything alone and I'm not sure if I'm on the right track or I'm just trying to fool myself to play with myself that I'm actually doing something great. Actually, it's not.
Coach: When you delay coding, what internal cues do you notice? How might these signals shape your view of the startup?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't delay coding. I do coding as much as I can. Because it's giving immediate feedback. I can see something built from my fingertips that really satisfy my dopamine. So how about if I show my view of startup? I don't know. Startup, I think you need to gather the right results and do something crazy. But I think I'm only good at doing something myself, not really 100% crazy. But just doing something myself. I'm not good at gathering a team, you know, around the same vision and then go crazy for that. So, yeah.
Coach: It sounds like your solo coding gives you immediate rewards, yet you see startup culture as needing a wild, team-driven push. What does that "crazy" energy look like to you, and how do you feel your solo approach fits within that vision?
--------------------------------------------------
User: The crazy energy is like just believing something about what happened and believing in yourself and your team that you can make that happen. That is the craziness. Despite all the otherwise, all the restrictions, all the limitations, all the obstacles, just believe that the good is yet to come and we can make it come. It's a plan of confidence, but it is super important. And I think my solo approach is like I tend to have that crazy belief because I'm naive, you know. But sometimes it's get consumed as well, especially when you see other teams, they have more proper setup, have money, have a real team, progress faster than me. It's making me feel maybe I'm just like a really naive small boy, you know. So I do hope that I'm right rather than I'm stupid. And I do hope there are other crazy people I can find and be crazy about the same thing that I'm about to build and we build it together. That really, really light me up.
Coach: It sounds like you're torn between the thrill of solo coding's immediate rewards and wanting a team that fuels that crazy belief. What are some moments when you felt that belief strongly, and how might those instances guide you in finding collaborators?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Most of the moment when you feel that belief strongly. When there's others agree with what I believe in, and they say, oh, this is a good idea, I think it can work. It makes me feel strongly. When I see the progress of the software development, that is really start to work. I feel the belief strongly. And when my teammate and other people feel the belief strong, I'm committing to it. Like when they start to give me the transcript at night, contribute to it, I feel it strongly. It's like if everyone thinks this is true, then it is truer. How might those instincts lead me to be a collaborator? I think the number one, first importance is that they need to have this crazy belief. Like the energy is really important. Because this energy, they can feel me, I can also feel them. So it's like one plus one greater than two, right? But if say there is someone in the team with really low energy, that I need to feel him, but he is like consuming my energy. They also get negative feedback that, okay, maybe we are stupid, maybe we are just naive, you know? I could be wrong. So this consumer energy is giving me like a negative feedback. I think number one is we need people to give each other positive feedback. And that is kind of the characteristic of people that need to believe in energy, believe in uncertainty, believe in himself that we just able to create something new, we able to create the future. I think that's fundamentally important. So it's like a startup people. I need to really find startup people to work together with me, no matter the skill side.
Coach: You've highlighted the importance of shared, positive energy. What might be your first step to connect with like-minded people?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think the important first step is to see where these people are. If those who seem indifferent, they tend to not believe. Even you consume a lot of energy pursuing them in, if you are less motivated, just give it a try and they don't really commit a lot. So I need to go to startup circle to attend some startup event and to find some people with like-minded side. And also people who are interested in this subject. Like another partner, he is really interested in coaching himself. He is a coach himself. So he is interested in doing this. I need to accept that. I might not have this pool of candidate who is the kind of people, you know, like just no matter what, just get his hand dirty to start to try something. Don't care whether they are a joke or not. This kind of people is less, you know, this less great smart people. I'm surrounding by a lot of real educated, fitting the precise, shiny, shiny people. They are not a startup person. No.
Coach: When attending those events, what specific signals will tell you you've found that energized circle?
--------------------------------------------------
User: you can automatically feel that. For example, in the previous project, when I was talking to another entrepreneur, we just talked about the idea and the day we got fascinated about it, we talked for a really long time and channeled the conversation to really deep. You know, it's like, even I feel it just could be a naive idea, I don't know what to do, but he might feel, yeah, that is really something have great potential. So he's adding energy. So when you're talking to people, you'll be able to signal that from the conversation. Like I think specific signal would be really interested in the topic, keep talking a lot, and then start to say, hey, how we can work together to the next move. So that is really important side to make things happen, to move things forward, rather than in a corporate setup. Yeah, because I think the working environment and what you do really shape your mindset and how you think and behave.
Coach: When you think about attending these events, what’s one conversation or interaction you could initiate this week that might reveal that startup energy?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I couldn't initiate this week because I'm going to meet them tomorrow. I think after I'm back Singapore, I will resume my agenda to attending this startup event to really talk to the peoples in this circle and just share about what we are doing and what we are about to do. Probably feedback I can feel that energy.
Coach: When you’re meeting tomorrow, what signals will help you decide which conversations to nurture into future actions?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think the signal is like we start to talk about the detail of implementation and how we can work together. That kind of person who is really having the mindset of how to make things happen. And I think he's really also having the energy and tendency to just start working on it tomorrow. Like instant. No, you know, that is the things I'm looking for. Say, hey, yeah, why don't we just like meet up tomorrow and discuss this further and see what can happen? Or hey, maybe let's try to develop that. Yeah, let's get started on it immediately. That is kind of signal I'm looking for.
Coach: When you notice that energy, how might you steer the conversation towards a concrete next step?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Like, when it is the energy, I think number one, it's like an offer. Like, hey, we are also looking for a partner on this journey. If you're interested, we can probably discuss how we can work together. And if this is a match, then we can start on it, right? Yeah, I think that's it. Just offer directly to do something together.
Coach: It sounds like you feel a direct approach works best. How do you think you could structure that conversation to foster commitment without putting too much pressure?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess like it's hard not putting too much pressure, but it's like, hey, we can just work on it together, you know, give it a try. Doesn't matter how, so if you're interested, involve you in to our next product discussion, and there's something you might be able to do, right? Then we have a session to say who can do what, and then start to allocate things. And of course, we need to explore what is people's interest, which role, what perspective I want to do. It will be also developing product like coding as me, and it could also be like to operate, to run the account, do some marketing things. It can also be to like talk to a different coach and ask them to come and donate their data, right? Depends on what perspective. That is interesting, and I can offer him to try. Basically what I offer is like a platform. So if you want to try, I'm open for you to try. Second is like if you want to try an interesting, I have the platform and things for you to try out, to try things out. And number three is that, yeah, like you can, if you think you're talented somewhere, you can really test it out. And then if it's really good result, you benefit from the result. I think that's really pretty good offer already.
Coach: That sounds like a thoughtful offer. What element do you think is most crucial to spark that immediate, shared commitment?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think it's interest. If they genuinely interest in doing something new, that's like the source power, right? So second thing is like the commitment. Now we also have people interested in this and trying to commit, but even myself, I have other things to do, right? So we are really just committing on part-time base, then it moves slower. So what I hope is this can eventually become a full-time thing, not only me, right? Other people also do this full-time. We just like go to the same place every day, coding or discuss about this every day, trying to make this happen every day. And it would be totally different. I'm trying to, I hope I could make something towards that direction. That would be really meaningful to me. And I guess the experience would be really good.
Coach: It sounds like you're envisioning a shift from part-time sparks to full-time commitment. What signs will tell you that that part-time energy is becoming a consistent, sustainable force within your team?
--------------------------------------------------
User: What science is that? I guess what we start to see is really taking off is when we start to have users, have good feedback, have cash flow, have investors talking to us, and seeing that it's everyone's time to come into this dream.
Coach: You've mentioned key external signals. What internal changes in you or your team might indicate it's time to transition fully?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't see any internal change. I think I'm ready for that. If today people say, hey, I don't have anything to do, let's just try it out. Let's just commit full time on this. We go to the same place, sit down together, develop together, and try to work things out together. I can do it full time immediately. For my other teammate, I don't know.
Coach: How might you open up a conversation with your teammate to explore what full-time commitment might look like for them?
--------------------------------------------------
User: OK, I mean, I think after we have some good feedback from the outside world, external factor, we can try to do that. But I think now it's not ready. But you just say no, right? What's the topic or what is our goal for today's discussion?
Coach: How might you invite your team to share what full-time collaboration feels like?
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, I do not want to discuss about this, OK?
Coach: I understand. Let's shift our focus. What would you like to explore now?
--------------------------------------------------
