User: Hello, let's talk about my career progression today, is that okay?
Coach: Yes, Andrew, where would you like to begin?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Maybe let's begin with my current situation. I currently am having two videos going and I don't feel I'm going anywhere further. I both are stuck in somewhere. The flooring is like really small things and I don't see there's potential to go up. Then the AI is like a small game I'm playing with myself.
Coach: So, how do you feel about your current situation?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel I'm not going anywhere and I'm wasting my precious time in my thirties.
Coach: Wow, that's a strong statement.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, but that's kind of how I feel. I'm not always feeling that, bouncing here and there. Sometimes I feel it's really this bad. Sometimes I feel I have great potential in my journey. Maybe the bond to do something, you know.
Coach: So, what do you think is the real situation?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think the real situation is like, the floor thing is like, that's about it, right? I'm not a person for that and it can be just hung there gathering some cash flow to sustain my living. So I'm quite happy with that. But the main futuristic that I've caught on is the AI things. But that is actually not progressing really fast, not fast enough to become a real business, to catch the wave, to give me a proper career as an entrepreneur.
Coach: So, how do you feel about the AI business?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel a lot of uncertainty.
Coach: And what do you think is causing that uncertainty?
