User: Hello, I want to talk about our progress of myself exploring on why I keep Mr. Fight.
Coach: What about this topic is most interesting or important for you to explore?
--------------------------------------------------
User: because I miss flight and I miss money.
Coach: What is the outcome you're hoping to achieve by the end of our conversation?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Not miss her flight again in the future, avoid making the same mistake.
Coach: What might be the deeper goal you're hoping to achieve?
--------------------------------------------------
User: It'll be more functional, and a better version of myself, I guess.
Coach: And what would be the impact of achieving that deeper goal?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I can get what I want.
Coach: What would that look like for you?
