User: Hello, hello. Maybe we can talk about that I want to build a great AI agent for an agency movie. It's really a wonderful opportunity after finish to be used in a great event that we launch a first agency movie to the world and as a user to use that AI agent. But now I'm quite nervous because I'm not confident that I'm able to build it out.
Coach: So you're sitting here with this amazing opportunity in front of you, and you notice that this lack of confidence is making you feel nervous.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Correct. So, I just afraid I cannot finish it. I think the time is quite short. Also, I never really complete products like that before, so I doubt my capability to build it from scratch. And I really don't want to let her down, like the audience down.
Coach: So, the fear of disappointing others is sitting with you as you think about this opportunity.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Correct.
Coach: On a scale from one to ten, how confident do you feel right now?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel confident of about like seven.
Coach: And what would you like to be by the end of this session?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Tänä päivänä.
Coach: Tänä päivänä.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I mean, I would like it to be 10.
Coach: I'm curious, how do you move from seven to 10 in the next 20 minutes?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess maybe we can explore some interesting move that I can take, like the action plan. So we can chop it step by step and able to execute and start to build it. Then we'll be more clear about what can achieve.
Coach: All right. So let's dive into that action plan. But before, I want to understand, what does a confident 10 version of yourself look like?
--------------------------------------------------
User: It look like super happy and productive. I'm doing something interesting and I know I'm able to do that, so don't have any exhausting thinking like I'm afraid of fear.
Coach: So, no exhausting thinking, but maybe you're aware of something that drains your energy right now.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes.
Coach: No, I want to hear that.
--------------------------------------------------
User: You are right.
Coach: So, in order to move from seven to 10, you need to exhaust something.
--------------------------------------------------
User: dahchen.
Coach: Let's explore that. You mentioned you're afraid of disappointing the audience. Tell me more about that.
--------------------------------------------------
User: If it doesn't work, it's done, right? It's really embarrassing. I guess there are many people there.
Coach: So, you're really afraid of letting the audience down. How many people will be watching?
--------------------------------------------------
User: 600
Coach: And how often do you get the chance to perform in front of 600 people?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I barely have such chance. For me, I just build something for fun, right? Create some app for fun and do it as a hobby. So normally when I build, only myself is using it and my co-builder is testing it. So I never seriously launch it to a mass number of people. So I never get a chance to let so many people to see my product and use my product.
Coach: So, you're noticing that you're moving from someone who rarely gets watched by an audience into 600 people.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, it's not like the person being watched is the product that I built, being used and tested by 600 people. The problem is I haven't started building and in fact, I don't even know. I just have a rough direction. I don't even know what is the detailed steps to give birth to this product step by step.
Coach: So, when you build something for fun, there's no pressure. But now, with the weight of 600 people, you feel drained by that expectation.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yep, I guess you can say so.
Coach: What are you doing in the way of building this energy?
--------------------------------------------------
User: What do you mean?
Coach: You're at seven, and you want to be at 10. You need to drain something.
--------------------------------------------------
User: What do you mean by drink something?
Coach: You need to exhaust that fear. How do you do that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess just start to talk to people who have done it before.
Coach: So, move from seven to 10, you may need to talk to someone to gain confidence. But first, let's finish the action plan.
--------------------------------------------------
User: What are you talking about?
Coach: You said, building something for fun, you have no pressure. But now, you're aware of the pressure of 600 people.
