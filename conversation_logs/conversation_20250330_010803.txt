User: Hello, today I want to talk about the balancing of my health and work and my body weight control, etc.
Coach: So, I heard you say health, work, body control, balancing, etc. So, what specifically you want to focus on today?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so basically it's like, how do I balance my work and my health condition? Like, you know that I'm working on an AI startup initiative to create some agents at the moment. So that's really interesting and really fascinate me a lot. So I spend quite a lot of time to research, learn and implement different solutions to experiment around, to test different methodology and building the AI agent. I'm really happy with this process. And on the other side, so it's consuming a lot of time. On the other side, I also having another main business that I need to travel quite a lot to meet different customers, to close deals. So both is actually taking quite a lot of time. So in the end of the day, I find it's hard to really squeeze out some time to sleep early, go to gym to exercise, have a more balanced lifestyle. So that is what I want to talk about today.
Coach: So I heard you say it's hard to squeeze out time to exercise, sleep early, have a balanced lifestyle. So what does a balanced lifestyle look like for you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess a balanced lifestyle is like you have enough time to exercise to be energizing productive, and also have enough time to do the work that really interests you, and also have time to spend with your family, with friends, you know, that would be a more balanced and more healthy, more sustainable lifestyle to me.
Coach: And how important is it for you to achieve a balanced lifestyle?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Well, I guess this is pretty important because like I guess that is like more sustainable. Like I used to have such a balanced lifestyle a few years back when I'm working in other people's company. So basically we work on the weekday and on the weekend we try not to work. Right. So I tend to master to learn something I'm interested and we also go to exercise, go to like hang out with friends. And I think it's like more sustainable. Like your body shape is better and you don't have any health condition and it's generally more sustainable way of living, I guess. Because I don't want to, although I really pretty interested in what I'm doing and want to want to create the product that I'm creating, but I don't want to like sacrifice my health and my like body shape, for example. Right. So it is quite important. Yeah.
Coach: So I heard you say that you used to have a balanced lifestyle a few years ago and it's more sustainable. And you mentioned health condition, body shape, sustainability. Is this balanced lifestyle more for the short term, for the long term perspective for you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I do wish to live a healthy, sustainable, and having high energy.
Coach: I do wish to live a healthy, sustainable and high energy lifestyle for a long term.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yes, correct.
Coach: So I heard you say that you used to have a balanced lifestyle a few years ago. So what's different compared to a few years ago?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess the main different is like now I'm like doing business myself and do startup myself. So I guess the mindset is different and you really want to see things happen. And like now I feel that right. I could just like for the sprint, just like chong for the few times for some days, right. Then reach another checkpoint, like no matter how. Then yeah, so basically this is the difference I guess. Like now we can just... Actually I don't know why, right. Like before I also want to achieve my target. I am kind of person really want to become a high achiever to see the results from my work, to see the product or the project is working. But like this didn't change actually. But just now I don't know why it's like I feel it's hard to maintain. I guess one particular reason is that while I'm traveling, I don't have the condition, right, to exercise regularly. Like last time I used to be able to eat salad every day for the lunch and dinner for continuously a few months. So I always buy the food from the same store, eat that food and then we go to gym at the same time every day, right. So I'm able to dedicate time and the condition is there to allow me to pick up my more healthy lifestyle. But now if I travel, you may not find any healthy food nearby you and you may like the weather is different and you won't be able to always like stay in the place, always having a gym and proper exercise facility. And sometimes when you entertain customers, you also like don't have the time, you know, especially it's like the time is not so manageable as previously. But on the other side, I do spend quite a lot of time in Singapore. Like that is I can have full control of my entire day. But I will previously, I guess it's like we need to go to company to work. So after job, then you go to gym to exercise, then you go home, right. So it's like this. But now it's like I have full control of my time, but I will become like wake up and then go to the laptop and start to the focus mode to work on something is really important, like to do some coding and create product creation. Then after that, I will go to do something that's more transitional, like doing day to day business. Yeah, then it's like it's reached to the night really quick. And then especially miss the time to exercise. Yeah, sometimes even miss the time to have lunch. So we like eat in really strange hours, sometimes like have a lunch at like 4pm. You know, this has become really common day to day to now.
Coach: So I heard you say that you have full control of your time now. But at the same time, you also mentioned that it's hard to squeeze out time, right, to exercise, to have healthy food. So what's the conflict here?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, it's a great question. So I think about the conflict here is that when I'm really into what I'm doing, you know, I just want to forget about every other things and only do what I'm interested in doing. It's like addicted to a game. But this game is to develop product, to create what I like to create. So I become fully indulged in it and don't even want to get disrupted by anything. You know, I really like a clean environment. Last time when I came back from trip, I spent a couple of hours to clean up my home, to rearrange the storeroom because that made me feel good. But once I'm working on something I'm really interested in working on, it becomes totally different. It's like I totally forget about whether it's clean or not. Everything else doesn't matter. I just want to work on it. It's like addicting to the game, that kind of feeling.
Coach: So I heard you say that when you're really into what you're doing, you just want to forget everything and just focus on that. So it sounds like you actually want to achieve the balanced lifestyle, but there is something preventing you from doing that.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yep, correct. It's like I'm really into what I'm doing and that is like sucking out my time. Right, so I guess it's because like now we are doing it as a startup, as an interest, as a hobby. And so it's make it even more interesting doing it. Right, so then I think that is the thing preventing me from doing that because I don't want to allocate any time or energy to other things. Right, it's like I don't want to leave the screen at all. So normally it's like when I'm in the product developing phase, sometimes I just work until like 3am in the morning and until it's too tired that your body tells you no, you need to sleep and then really feel sleepy and then I just sit on my sofa bin in my room and then just like immediately fall asleep and sleep on the floor. Yeah, like the bed is just like next door but then I just never go to the bed. It's become like sleeping in the office kind of feeling. Yeah, so I don't know, maybe like, I mean I don't know whether this is good or bad. I guess maybe it's also pretty good actually. It's like the startup kind of feeling, you know, many people they sleep in the office like they never leave the office in the phase when they in the early stage and they do it because they just like to do it and they want to just like to start up things, just like to create new product. I mean, I kind of in that kind of feeling. So that is good. But on the other side, it's also like deprive my health, right, which is also a concerning point to it.
Coach: So you mentioned that when you're really into what you're doing, you can work until 3am and you just fall asleep on the sofa. So how do you feel about that?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, I feel it's like, well, it's like, well, I'm doing it, I really enjoy it, and so I will just keep doing this, because I'm in the flow, right? But on the second day, okay, so typically on the second day, because you cannot have proper sleep from there, so it's become when I wake up from the sofa bin, I go to the bedroom and go to bed and sleep for another couple of hours. Yeah, because once your body leaves that stage, right, leave that flow, then you feel the tiredness, because you really need to sleep to recover, right? So then you wake up to sleep on the next day, sometimes in the morning. And then after I wake up, so it's like, basically, you miss the morning, so you no longer have the morning time. Like, for example, in Singapore, the best time to exercise is either in the morning or at 5 or 6 p.m. at night, right? So what I do is like, yeah, I feel a bit regret because it's like, hey, I really live the healthy lifestyle, but it's like because of that I didn't do it, a bit regret for that. But again, on that day, right, so I go to my laptop and start coding, start development, and I get to suck into it again. And until like 3 a.m. again, and still don't want to stop and to have to, right? So this becomes a repetitive pattern that I cannot break.
Coach: So it sounds like you actually, you kind of enjoy that, but at the same time, you also feel some regrets.
--------------------------------------------------
User: You are exactly right.
Coach: And you mentioned that you want to live a healthy lifestyle. So what does a balanced lifestyle look like for you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, I think we talked about this before, like a more balanced lifestyle is like, wake up early in the morning, go to exercise, go to meditation, then start up a deep work in the morning time for maybe three to four hours, then having a lunch at like 12 to 1 p.m., really controlled, and then working on other things that I need to coordinate with people or reply emails, or you know, like not deep work, but like some coordination work or business work in the afternoon. And after 6 p.m., the whole world is like not no more working, go to exercise, I mean, if you exercise in the morning, probably you won't exercise, like go for dinner, walk dog, right? Then start some deep work again in the night, maybe like 7 or 8 p.m. until 11 p.m., then from there, like do some reflection and wind down around 12, and then happily go to sleep. And the next day, happily wake up early in the morning. That would be a more ideal and healthy lifestyle to me.
Coach: And how is that different from what you're doing now?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Like now is like we work at maybe like we have a 10, 11, then do some deep work until 2 p.m., 3 p.m., then go to lunch. I have a really simple lunch and then work on the like coordination things for 3 hours to 6 p.m. Then like normally by 6 p.m., you cannot finish because the time is too short. So you drag over 1 to 2 hours, then it's become 8 p.m. And at 8 p.m. it's not late, so I do time to work out. So then you feel like, oh, I don't want to swim anymore, don't want to exercise anymore, so you just didn't exercise. And then like 8 p.m. start to work on the deep focus mode for the product development. Then work until 3 a.m. in the morning until you cannot last, and then sleep on the floor. Yeah, that is what I'm doing now.
Coach: So I heard you say that you actually, you don't really start the deep work until 8 p.m.
--------------------------------------------------
User: So there is two batch in the morning, I also start deep work. And restart the deep work until 8pm again because at that time no one will disturb me.
Coach: So you mentioned that in the ideal lifestyle, you would have the deep work in the morning and also after 6pm. But now you actually have the deep work, start the deep work in the afternoon. So what's the difference?
--------------------------------------------------
User: What do you mean by difference?
Coach: What's the difference between now and the ideal lifestyle? You mentioned that in the ideal lifestyle, you would have the deep work in the morning and also after 6pm. But now you actually have the deep work just in the afternoon.
--------------------------------------------------
User: No, you're wrong. Now I have the deep work in the morning as well and also at night. But it starts later in the morning and it also starts later at night.
Coach: So you mentioned that in the ideal lifestyle, you would start the deep work in the morning and also have it after 6pm. But now you actually have the deep work in the morning, but it starts late.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Correct, you get the first half of the answer right, and also resumed the deep work at night, but also a bit late, maybe around 8pm.
Coach: So what's the reason that this is happening?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Because like the previous day you sleep really late and your body is really tired and you need more rest time.
Coach: So your body is actually the one controlling your time, not you.
--------------------------------------------------
User: That's an interesting way to say it. But yes, it's like the body is controlling it. Like the body decides, no, I'm still indulging in the work, I want to continue, so just continue. The body is too tired, need more rest, then just rest. It's like it's hard to be the master of your mind. Yeah, it's like if I can be the master of my mind, then it's different. But it's like, I think it's not the body, I think it's the mind. And then my mind is like controlling my behavior. And the mind says, oh, I'm so into the work, don't stop, then just continue, don't stop. The mind says, oh, no, it's too tired, I need to take more rest, then take more rest.
Coach: So you mentioned that you really enjoy what you're doing and you just want to keep going. So what would it take for you to actually master your mind?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, good question. So I guess number one is like actually I know I cannot just keep going because that is not sustainable and it's actually reduced my productivity reversely and at the same time I'm having a health issue and lose my body shape, right? So I know that is wrong. It's just I need to be able to master my mind so that I can control my body, control my behavior. I guess that's one approach. So what it takes to master my mind is like previously I learned that I can do some Vipassana like meditation. That's a really good way to master my mind. Yeah, so maybe I should resume that, just try to do some meditation, like break the chain. Yeah. But sometimes it's like it's just been quite a long while that I'm not so indulged in my work, you know. I actually quite also like this feeling and I don't want to kill this feeling. It's been a long while that I haven't had this kind of feeling. Yeah, I guess that's also part of the reason, right? Like you're so thirsty and finally you have some water. Just drink. You're so damn thirsty. Just drink. To like revengefully drinking.
Coach: So how do you feel about the idea of actually mastering your mind?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think I can try that. I could really try that to do some meditation. So, well, I'm most able to control myself. Do some meditation maybe after becoming the morning. Just for maybe 10 minutes, 15 minutes and see how it goes. It could help. I could do a simple experiment to try it out.
Coach: And you mentioned that you don't want to kill the feeling of really enjoying what you're doing.
--------------------------------------------------
User: I want to kill that feeling.
Coach: So you said that you really enjoy what you're doing and you don't want to kill that feeling. But at the same time, you want to master your mind. So how do those two fit together?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I don't know, like when you become a man master, you may lose that feeling, you know. So that's what I'm worried about. But on the other side, it could also be like after you're really able to control your mind, like the feeling is like you're not that patient. It's like it's really like you don't have answers, you don't have like a strong emotion. You don't control the emotion. And so you also become peaceful, right? And then you're also less patient, passionate about what you're doing. That could be. Yeah. So I don't know. Just try, right? Just give it a try.
Coach: Yeah, I think it's a balance. Maybe I can try to see how it goes.
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, exactly.
Coach: So if we put this into a scale of one to ten, how close are you to the ideal balance of mind control versus enjoying what you're doing?
--------------------------------------------------
User: How close are you to the ideal balance? I think it's quite far. Maybe five, I guess, to the ideal balance. Because now it's like totally like that patient, let the feeling of enjoy what you're doing drive me, right? Totally no control.
Coach: And what would it take for you to get to 5.5, just 0.5 closer?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess the awareness, after talking to this, I think I have deeper awareness from this conversation. And if I practice meditation continuously for a couple of days, it could easily go to seven.
Coach: And how would you feel about the meditation practice?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I feel really peaceful, it's really working to make me become the master of the mind.
Coach: And you mentioned that you can try this out for let's say 10 to 15 minutes a day. How consistent do you think you can be with this practice?
--------------------------------------------------
User: All this thing is hard to say. If I wake up, there's nothing else disturb me, I guess I can just try to do this. But if say, sometimes I wake up, there's message, there's emergency for you to handle already, then it's like I won't be able to let them wait, I will respond immediately and then get sucked into those job, those problems. Then I will miss the meditation window. And once you lose that mood, it's quite hard to do meditation.
Coach: It looks like we've made good progress on your issue. Shall we wrap up today's session with a quick summary and an action plan? If yes, please say wrap up and summarize.
