Coach: It seems like you've gained some clarity on how to structure your time and reflect on your progress, which is a valuable practice. How do you feel about implementing this plan, and what support do you think you might need to help you stay accountable to this routine?
--------------------------------------------------
User: 嗯，我觉得，如果你把这个当成一个程序，是不是我需要牺牲深度工作？那是让我无法入睡并陷入循环的主要事情，所以就像一个硬约束，所以在晚上12点停止工作，进行反思，然后做其他事情。所以我不允许在晚上工作。等一下，我先把它写下来。好，我的工作是什么样子？好的，所以说在晚上12点我需要停止工作，停止深度工作。所以这就是我的程序给我的约束，然后进行反思。30分钟，所以如果我在晚上8点开始工作，那么这意味着有4个小时的工作。所以这已经足够了。然后在早上需要另外两个小时，所以也许从早上8点到10点，两个小时的工作。所以在这期间，我有从早上10点到10点的10个小时，用于其他事情。所以其他事情，比如商业，像锻炼，冥想等等。我认为这应该足够了。所以只要我能练习这个，我可能就能够打破这个循环并实现它。

Coach: I think we have covered a lot today and it is about the end of our session today. Would you like to wrap up our session with a final summary and action plan? If yes, please say wrap up and summarize.

It seems you've identified a clear plan to establish boundaries around your work time, allowing for reflection and other important activities. You're aiming to stop working by midnight, reflect for 30 minutes, and allocate specific hours for deep work. How do you feel about this structure, and what will be your first step to put it into action?
--------------------------------------------------
User: OK, the first step is I will just start to do it tonight. So I will try to minimize other time-consuming things today and try to get six hours of work and see how it works, right, to get tired enough. And then I will really force myself to stop at 12 and then do this reflection. And even if I'm not sleepy, I won't do this addicting project. I will try to do something boring and just force to sleep and then to break the loop. I can try today.

It sounds like you’re ready to take actionable steps towards breaking the cycle and establishing a healthier routine. By committing to a six-hour work session tonight and stopping at midnight for reflection, you're setting a clear boundary. How will you ensure you stay committed to this plan, and what might you do if you feel tempted to work beyond your set time?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Okay, I guess I will add this to my reflection as well. So besides reflect on deep work, also reflect on how am I able to follow the routine to control my work at six hours. So with that I have a log, and if I, let's say in the week, I'm following from the log shows that I'm really doing well, I will reward myself with something I like. And if not, if I work beyond the time, this is like a punishment, right? So I will punish myself. Yeah, I just do that to see whether I can make myself listening to my math

It seems you've established a solid plan for accountability through reflection and rewards, which can be motivating. How do you feel about the balance between rewarding yourself and the self-discipline aspect of this approach?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I think for me self-discipline is hard sometimes. So just for a long time I guess I could be more self-disciplined because this thing is to make me more self-disciplined, right? That is like a goal. And every word is like give you an initiative force to go to a self-discipline mode. And after you get used to it, it becomes automatic. You don't need to keep rewarding people.
