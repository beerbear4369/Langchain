User: Hello, so I want to test, I have an issue, like sometimes when I ask, it's like some new bugs, and really hard to come back.
Coach: What would you like to explore today regarding the issue with the bugs?
--------------------------------------------------
User: What's the best way to do the testing and able to minimize the buggy code?
Coach: What would make this conversation meaningful for you in addressing the testing and minimizing buggy code?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Good question, I guess. If we come up with a better way
Coach: How will you know we've succeeded by the end of our conversation? What would a better way look like for you?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Please summarize.
--------------------------------------------------
Coach: KEY DISCUSSION POINTS:
- Client's challenge with testing and minimizing buggy code
- Exploring a better way to approach testing
- Defining success as coming up with a new strategy

MAIN BREAKTHROUGHS:
- Client acknowledged the need for a new strategy in testing
- Client expressed interest in finding a better way to minimize buggy code

ACTION PLAN:
1. Research and explore different testing methodologies to find a more effective approach
2. Implement a pilot testing project using the new strategy to evaluate its effectiveness
3. Regularly review and analyze the results of the new testing strategy to make necessary adjustments

Final Note:
Embrace the process of trial and error in finding the best testing approach for your projects. Stay open to learning and adapting as you work towards minimizing buggy code. You're on the right track!
