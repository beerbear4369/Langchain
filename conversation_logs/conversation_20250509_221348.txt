Coach: You've articulated your values beautifully. How might these insights guide your next steps in aligning your actions with your purpose?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, so don't let's see what contributed it, what not contributed it. Like now, let me open my to-do list. Okay, so I need to, I mean, okay, so one is for this AI coach, I need to adjust some software design and UI, write API. So after doing this, I have an MVP of this AI coach. And does it help to this doing useful things? I think yes, like this coach, this software potentially can help people to reflect, to think, right? So that is aligned with my value. So I should do this. I should prioritize this, right? But when I say this, there's also, there's many uncertainty because like how you can bring this to people, maybe no one will really use it. You know, in the end of the day, you may just create a product that your own testing, your own use, your own user, and it will make me feel so miserable, you know. And then let me move to the second. Okay, so before we move to the second one, so let's continue with this. So yeah, this is good, but there's uncertainty because maybe it's like waste time. You thought you contributed, but in the end, no one used it, so it never happened. You never success to achieve your purpose, but that is one possible one, right? So I gave it a plus one, yeah, gave it mark. Second, catch up with team for KPA calculation because I need to sell their salary, like code for the construction project. That two actually don't relate to us, so if I do it, it just like help me keep the customer so I can get some more project from them next time they can arrest me and give the accountant some accounting information. That don't help, that just keep the construction business going, make the staff have salary, make the customer stick with us, make the finance able to process. These are really pending tasks, but that's the thing I really have to do to make the companies stay alive and make a living. Can make a living is important because otherwise I won't be able to do useful things to achieve my target, so I still need to do it. So that's plus one and uncertainty, so actually that is plus two. Okay, then let's continue moving on. Paying people, blame trying to handle tasks. Yeah, so basically some admin things but keep the business going and trying to get more profit. That's also important because writing me is like enable me to chase my dream. So basically I think here we can discover the foundation, the precondition of you able to do useful things. It's number one, you are financially independent, there is money, you don't have to worry for food. Second, you have time to contribute to what you are doing. So the first one, but the first one is taking time as well, so that's the pain.
--------------------------------------------------
Coach: You've identified what's aligned with your values and what sustains your foundation. How might you balance these priorities to move forward confidently?
--------------------------------------------------
User: Yeah, I think it's a good exercise, like to write this exercise to stature. I think the important thing is time. Because I really want to profit my time to spend on the making living things, right? So ideally, if I don't need to spend one minute a day and still able to make a living, and I can spend the rest of the time on my real purpose, right? That would be the ideal day, but it's impossible. Like currently I still need to do much things. So I would say, how about this? Let me block a certain percentage of time to make a living and a certain percentage of time to doing things with purpose. Just block the time as a resource, so I won't be spending all the time on the living and then don't have time for the dreaming. Or just like entirely indulge myself in doing the things I feel with purpose and then let the business down. Yeah, I think that's what I should do, like block my time as a resource. Second, I guess. Yeah, probably I should also... Second is like I didn't manage anything. I'm still like trying to achieve everything here. Yeah, so I will try to utilize more resource like for the traditional business, just trying to make other people able to do more, right? Save myself from the real operation. Spend more money to get people there to do the things. Get the Chinese resource to work more on the things here. Because they are basically the free resource.

--------------------------------------------------
User: No, I would like to continue our discovery.
--------------------------------------------------
Coach: Okay, let's continue our conversation.

What specific steps could you take to manage your time and resources more effectively?
--------------------------------------------------
User: I guess I don't need to do anything like simple. Just look up the time in my calendar. And in that time I won't respond to anything that's not to my purpose, right? That could be one of the ways. But sometimes the urgency is happening. Like you just need to go to site and once you go to site, like when they pass really fast. I guess just block out my time as I previously thinking. You know, just block out certain time of day, at night, and probably at early morning. But the important things are to really work now. I think that's the easier way. And then say sorry to the translation business because that is just a money-making things. Do as fast as possible, try to close, forget and cancel money. Use like rubbish time to do that.
