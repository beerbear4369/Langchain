User: You know, you're all serious really quick, uh-huh Like be able to push out this MVP is my success So now I just left is the one small step about any conversation How I can end this with a summary page and then that's it. That's What I'm scoped to develop for the MVP a long time ago, then I'm going to deploy it to some web service and from there maybe I need to adjust some You know URL for the integration But that shouldn't be a big problem. Then I'm done right I'm also able to launch a small product
Coach: Completing the MVP sounds exciting! What strengths or resources do you have to finalize that summary page?
