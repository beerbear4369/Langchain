FINAL SUMMARY AND ACTION PLAN
==================================================

In the coaching session, we discussed the client's commitment to making changes for their wellbeing by reducing their weekly work hours to 45 or less and having weekends free. The client will track their progress by keeping a log of hours each week and reviewing it every Sunday. Their spouse will provide support by reminding them to disconnect when working too much.

Actionable Steps:
1. Block off non-work hours in your schedule to prioritize your wellbeing.
2. Keep a log of your work hours each week and review it on Sundays to track progress.
3. Have open communication with your spouse about your work habits and ask for their support in disconnecting when needed.

Remember, progress takes time and effort. Stay committed to your goals and celebrate each step towards a healthier work-life balance. You've got this!
