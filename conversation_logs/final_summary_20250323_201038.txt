FINAL SUMMARY AND ACTION PLAN
==================================================

In our coaching session, we discussed your desire to move into a leadership position after being in the same role for 4 years with no growth opportunities. Your main challenge is the lack of experience in leadership roles, despite your willingness to take on more responsibility. We explored options such as seeking volunteer opportunities and taking courses to develop leadership skills outside of work.

Actionable Steps:
1. Look for volunteer opportunities that allow you to lead and make decisions, gaining practical leadership experience.
2. Enroll in leadership courses or workshops to enhance your skills and knowledge in areas such as communication, decision-making, and conflict resolution.
3. Take initiative at work by proposing projects or tasks that demonstrate your leadership potential, even if your manager initially says to wait.

Remember, taking proactive steps to develop your leadership skills will not only benefit you in your current role but also prepare you for future opportunities. Keep pushing forward and believe in your ability to grow and succeed.
