FINAL SUMMARY AND ACTION PLAN
==================================================

In the coaching session, we discussed the client's commitment to making changes for their wellbeing by reducing work hours to 45 or less per week and having weekends free. The client will track progress by keeping a log of hours and reviewing it weekly, with support from their spouse to remind them to disconnect. The main challenges include maintaining work-life balance and accountability, while the insights highlight the importance of setting measurable goals and having a support system in place.

Actionable steps for the client:
1. Continue tracking work hours and reviewing progress weekly.
2. Set boundaries with work tasks and prioritize self-care activities.
3. Engage in regular check-ins with spouse to ensure accountability and support.
4. Practice mindfulness techniques to disconnect from work during non-work hours.
5. Seek guidance from the coach on strategies to maintain work-life balance.

Remember, progress takes time and effort. Stay committed to your goals and prioritize your wellbeing. You've taken the first step towards positive change, and I believe in your ability to succeed.
