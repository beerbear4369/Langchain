FINAL SUMMARY AND ACTION PLAN
==================================================

During the coaching session, we discussed the urgency of the situation where the management team needs to finalize a contract within two days. The client expressed a sense of urgency and desperation in trying to win back the project. It was highlighted that simply begging for reconsideration may not be effective.

Key Challenges:
1. Urgency of the situation
2. Lack of confidence in the current approach
3. Need for a more strategic and proactive plan

Actionable Steps:
1. Reach out to the management team with a well-prepared proposal highlighting the value and benefits of reconsidering the project.
2. Offer a solution or compromise that could potentially sway their decision in your favor.
3. Seek support or advice from colleagues or mentors on how to approach the situation more strategically.
4. Prepare for the possibility of not winning back the project and have a contingency plan in place.

Remember, Ian, you have the ability to navigate this challenging situation with a clear and strategic mindset. Stay focused and proactive in your approach. You got this!
