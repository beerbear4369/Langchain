FINAL SUMMARY AND ACTION PLAN
==================================================

During the coaching session, we discussed setting a deadline for your research project and adding it to your to-do list. The main challenge identified was the need to prioritize and follow through on this action. An insight that emerged was the importance of being specific and committed to your goals.

Actionable steps:
1. Set a specific deadline for your research project and add it to your to-do list immediately.
2. Break down the project into smaller tasks to make it more manageable.
3. Schedule regular check-ins with yourself to track your progress and make adjustments as needed.
4. Consider seeking an accountability partner to help you stay on track and motivated.

Remember, progress is made one step at a time. Stay focused and committed to your goals. You've got this!
