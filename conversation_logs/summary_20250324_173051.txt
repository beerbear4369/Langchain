AI: Wow, I really love how you're measuring the progress. I mean, you mentioned on one hand, you're looking at a zoomed in view, where you can see the progress every day, because the feedback is so immediate. But then sometimes you zoom out and then you feel, am I just redoing things that are already done? And then you mentioned, you know, at times, you feel that you could be just making obvious mistakes, and that is slowing down the progress. And that perspective, you're feeling the progress is quite slow. But on the other hand, you also mentioned that, you know, as long as you're learning, and as long as you can feel that you're getting better, you are happy with the progress. So just curious, I mean, you mentioned these two perspectives. So what is the impact on you? I mean, how do you feel about the progress?
