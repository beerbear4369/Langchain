# Active Context: API Conversation Logic Refinement

## 1. Current Focus

The primary focus of the most recent work has been to **harden and verify the conversation control flow within the API**, specifically the logic for ending a session. The goal was to ensure the API's behavior perfectly matches the more mature logic of the standalone `main.py` application, especially in handling the two-step wrap-up confirmation process.

## 2. Recent Activities

1.  **Creation of a Targeted Test:** A new test file (`test_conversation_flow.py`) was created to simulate a realistic, multi-step user conversation using pre-recorded audio files. This test was designed to specifically target the wrap-up initiation and confirmation sequence.
2.  **Bug Identification:** The test revealed a critical logical flaw in `app.py`. The endpoint was misinterpreting a confirmation message (e.g., "Yes, wrap up") as a *new* request to end the session, causing it to re-ask the confirmation question in a loop instead of terminating the session.
3.  **Bug Fix:** The issue was resolved by refactoring the conditional logic in the `send_audio_message` function in `app.py`. The code was reordered to **prioritize checking for an expected confirmation** (`awaitingWrapUpConfirmation == True`) *before* checking for new wrap-up keywords.
4.  **Verification:** The fix was verified by successfully running the test script against the patched `app.py`.
5.  **Comparative Analysis:** A detailed comparison was performed between `app.py` and `main.py` to confirm that the core logic for session management, conversation flow, and wrap-up is now consistent between the API and the standalone version.

## 3. Key Learnings & Decisions

*   **Stateful Logic is Tricky in a Stateless World:** This bug highlighted the challenges of implementing state-dependent conversational flows (like a two-step confirmation) in a stateless API. The solution is to have a strict and explicit order of operations for checking user intent.
*   **The Session Dictionary is the Source of Truth:** The `sessions` dictionary in `app.py` is critical for simulating state. All session attributes, including the `awaitingWrapUpConfirmation` flag, must be reliably stored and retrieved from it.

## 4. Next Steps

*   The immediate next steps should focus on continuing to build out the API's features and ensuring its stability.
*   The in-memory session storage is a known limitation that needs to be addressed for production readiness by fully implementing the `database_service.py` for persistent storage.
