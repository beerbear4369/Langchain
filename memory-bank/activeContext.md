# Active Context: Model Enhancement & API Stability

## 1. Current Focus

The primary focus has shifted to **AI model enhancement and optimization**. A significant upgrade has been implemented to improve the coaching conversation quality through a custom fine-tuned model with enhanced emotional intelligence capabilities.

**Recent Model Update:**
- **New Model:** `gpt41mini_hyper2` (deployed June 16th, 2025)
- **Key Improvement:** Enhanced emotional intelligence (EQ) in coaching prompts
- **Training Data:** 49 vetted coaching dialogs for improved conversation quality
- **Base Model:** GPT-4.1-mini (2025-04-14)

## 2. Recent Activities

1.  **Model Migration:** Successfully updated the system to use the new fine-tuned model `gpt41mini_hyper2` with enhanced emotional intelligence capabilities.
2.  **Previous Stability Work:** Earlier work focused on hardening conversation control flow, specifically the wrap-up confirmation process. This foundation enables the enhanced model to work within a robust conversation framework.
3.  **Configuration Management:** Model selection is now centralized in `config.py` with multiple model options available for different use cases.
4.  **Quality Enhancement:** The new model provides more emotionally aware and contextually appropriate coaching responses.

## 3. Key Learnings & Decisions

*   **Fine-tuned Models Show Superior Performance:** The custom coaching model demonstrates significantly better emotional awareness and coaching effectiveness compared to base models.
*   **Model Configuration Flexibility:** The system architecture supports easy model switching through configuration changes, enabling quick testing and deployment of model improvements.
*   **Emotional Intelligence is Critical:** Enhanced EQ capabilities in the AI model directly translate to better user experience and coaching outcomes.

## 4. Next Steps

*   **Monitor Model Performance:** Observe real-world performance of the new model in production environments.
*   **Database Integration:** Continue work on persistent storage implementation for session data.
*   **Performance Analytics:** Consider implementing metrics to measure coaching effectiveness with the new model.
*   **Model Evolution:** Potential future fine-tuning iterations based on user feedback and conversation quality assessments.
