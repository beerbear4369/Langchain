# Product Context: Kuku Coach API

## 1. Problem Statement

Traditional coaching can be expensive, subject to scheduling constraints, and not always available the moment it's needed. Users seeking personal or professional development lack an accessible, on-demand tool for guided self-reflection and problem-solving. While standalone AI tools exist, they often lack a polished, integrative experience and the nuanced conversational flow required for effective coaching.

## 2. Product Vision

The Kuku Coach API aims to power a new generation of coaching applications by providing an intelligent, voice-driven conversation engine. The vision is to create a user experience that feels as natural and supportive as talking to a human coach. The user should be able to start a session, speak freely about their challenges, and be guided by the AI toward clarity and actionable steps.

## 3. Core User Experience Goals

*   **Seamless Interaction:** The user experience should be voice-first and feel like a natural conversation. The user should not have to worry about the underlying technology.
*   **Intelligent Guidance:** The AI should not just passively respond but actively guide the conversation, listen for cues, and know when it's the right time to summarize, offer solutions, or conclude the session.
*   **Trust and Reliability:** The user must trust the system to handle their conversation history securely and to manage the session state reliably. An accidental disconnection or a misunderstood command to end the session would be a significant failure.
*   **Graceful Endings:** The end of a coaching session is as important as the beginning. The wrap-up process should feel professional and intentional, not abrupt. The two-step confirmation for ending a session is critical to this experience, as it gives the user control and prevents accidental termination.
