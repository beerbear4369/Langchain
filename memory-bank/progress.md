# Project Progress: Kuku Coach API

## 1. What Works

*   **Core API Endpoints:** The fundamental API endpoints for managing the lifecycle of a coaching session are implemented and functional.
    *   `POST /api/sessions`: Successfully creates new sessions.
    *   `GET /api/sessions/{id}`: Successfully retrieves session status.
    *   `POST /api/sessions/{id}/messages`: Handles the core conversational exchange.
    *   `POST /api/sessions/{id}/end`: Allows for forcefully ending a session.
*   **Conversation Flow:** The API can successfully process a multi-turn conversation, maintain context using a session ID, and generate AI responses.
*   **Audio Processing:** The API correctly handles the intake of audio files, sends them for transcription, and links to a text-to-speech audio file in the response.
*   **Session Wrap-Up Logic (V2 - Hardened):** The complex logic for ending a conversation is now working as intended and is robustly tested.
    *   **User-initiated wrap-up requests are correctly identified.**
    *   **The two-step confirmation prompt is correctly issued.**
    *   **User confirmation is now correctly processed, leading to a graceful session end.**
    *   The previous logic loop bug has been **fixed and verified**.
*   **State Simulation:** The system for simulating statefulness (tracking elapsed time, message counts, and confirmation status) using the in-memory `sessions` dictionary is functional and effective for development.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   **Persistent Session Storage:** The most critical next step is to move from the temporary in-memory session dictionary to a persistent database. The `database_service.py` for Supabase integration has been started but needs to be fully implemented and integrated into all the API endpoints. This will prevent data loss on server restarts.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** While basic error handling is in place, it could be made more robust to handle edge cases like failed database calls, timeouts from external APIs (OpenAI, ElevenLabs), or malformed requests.
*   **User Authentication/Management:** Currently, sessions are anonymous. A user management system will be needed so that users can view their past session history.
*   **Full Test Coverage:** While the wrap-up logic is now tested, more unit and integration tests should be written to cover other features and potential edge cases.
*   **Configuration Management:** API keys and other sensitive configurations are currently accessible in the codebase. A more secure method, like using environment variables and a `.env` file, should be standardized.

## 3. Current Status

The project is in a good state. The core functionality is implemented, and a critical, complex bug has been resolved, which significantly de-risks the project. The API is ready for the next phase of development, which should prioritize moving to a persistent database.
