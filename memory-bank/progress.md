# Project Progress: Kuku Coach API

## 1. What Works

*   **Core API Endpoints:** The fundamental API endpoints for managing the lifecycle of a coaching session are implemented and functional.
    *   `POST /api/sessions`: Successfully creates new sessions.
    *   `GET /api/sessions/{id}`: Successfully retrieves session status.
    *   `POST /api/sessions/{id}/messages`: Handles the core conversational exchange.
    *   `POST /api/sessions/{id}/end`: Allows for forcefully ending a session.
*   **Enhanced AI Conversation Engine:** The API now uses an advanced fine-tuned model for superior coaching quality.
    *   **Model:** `gpt41mini_hyper2` with enhanced emotional intelligence capabilities
    *   **Training:** 49 vetted coaching dialogs for optimized conversation flow
    *   **Benefits:** More emotionally aware and contextually appropriate responses
*   **Conversation Flow:** The API can successfully process a multi-turn conversation, maintain context using a session ID, and generate AI responses.
*   **Audio Processing:** The API correctly handles the intake of audio files, sends them for transcription, and links to a text-to-speech audio file in the response.
*   **Session Wrap-Up Logic (V2 - Hardened):** The complex logic for ending a conversation is now working as intended and is robustly tested.
    *   **User-initiated wrap-up requests are correctly identified.**
    *   **The two-step confirmation prompt is correctly issued.**
    *   **User confirmation is now correctly processed, leading to a graceful session end.**
    *   The previous logic loop bug has been **fixed and verified**.
*   **State Simulation:** The system for simulating statefulness (tracking elapsed time, message counts, and confirmation status) using the in-memory `sessions` dictionary is functional and effective for development.
*   **Model Configuration Management:** Flexible model selection system through `config.py` allowing for easy model upgrades and testing.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   **Persistent Session Storage:** The most critical next step is to move from the temporary in-memory session dictionary to a persistent database. The `database_service.py` for Supabase integration has been started but needs to be fully implemented and integrated into all the API endpoints. This will prevent data loss on server restarts.
*   **Model Performance Analytics:** Implement metrics and monitoring to track the effectiveness of the new enhanced model in real coaching scenarios.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** While basic error handling is in place, it could be made more robust to handle edge cases like failed database calls, timeouts from external APIs (OpenAI, ElevenLabs), or malformed requests.
*   **User Authentication/Management:** Currently, sessions are anonymous. A user management system will be needed so that users can view their past session history.
*   **Full Test Coverage:** While the wrap-up logic is now tested, more unit and integration tests should be written to cover other features and potential edge cases.
*   **Configuration Management:** API keys and other sensitive configurations are currently accessible in the codebase. A more secure method, like using environment variables and a `.env` file, should be standardized.

## 3. Current Status

The project is in an excellent state with a significant quality upgrade. The enhanced AI model provides superior coaching capabilities with improved emotional intelligence. The core functionality is implemented, critical bugs have been resolved, and the system now delivers higher-quality coaching conversations. The API is ready for the next phase of development, which should prioritize moving to a persistent database and implementing performance monitoring for the enhanced model.
