# Chatbot Application Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview
An intelligent conversational assistant that accepts spoken input, processes it using advanced language models, and responds with synthesized speech. The application leverages OpenAI's Whisper for speech recognition, GPT-4o for natural language understanding and generation, and OpenAI's TTS for speech synthesis, all orchestrated through LangChain.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to speak to the chatbot and receive spoken responses so that I can interact hands-free.
2. As a user, I want the chatbot to remember our conversation context so that I don't have to repeat information.
3. As a user, I want clear, natural-sounding responses that address my queries accurately.
4. As a user, I want to see a text transcript of our conversation for reference.
5. As a user, I want minimal setup and configuration to start using the chatbot.
