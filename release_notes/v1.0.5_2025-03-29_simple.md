# AI Coach Updates

## Version 1.0.5 (March 29, 2025)

### What's New
- **Improved conversation records**: Your coaching conversations will now save properly including the final summary and action plans. This means you'll have complete records of all your coaching sessions.

- **Faster response times**: We've optimized how the coach responds when wrapping up sessions, making the experience smoother and quicker.

- **check wrapup after 15 round**: We have changed the threshold to check for wrapup to start from 15 round (previously 20 round). This will prevent redundent converation while the conversation is already fully explored

### Benefits for You
- All your coaching conversations are now saved completely, including the important final summaries
- The coach responds faster when suggesting to wrap up a session
- More reliable conversation history for reviewing your progress

### What This Means
When you finish a coaching session and the coach provides a final summary with action steps, this information will now be properly saved and available for you to review later. The application will also feel more responsive during wrap-ups.
