USER: Hi, my name is Ian. I want to discuss about my sleeping pattern. I have trouble sleeping very late every night and wake up very late every morning as well, so I want to change that behavior, but I just cannot do that. I don't know why. I keep repeating the same mistake, so I know it's not good. I just cannot help myself to escape from it. Yeah, so with this conversation, I hope I'm able to find a plan or actionable way to sleep well, wake up well, live a good life.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER: Well, what did you generate?

ASSISTANT: Iaan, it's so interesting. You mentioned you don't like to be managed or controlled, and even that includes not wanting to listen to yourself. But it's clear that something internal motivates you—otherwise, you wouldn't be here. What do you think that might be?

RATING: No (Needs Improvement) [weight=0]
BETTER RESPONSE: test

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXCHANGE #4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER: What internally motivated me is that I like myself to don't behave in that way. It's like to take control of myself, to be able to live the life that I like to be, right? For example, there's two persons in my body. There's a master and there's a body. The master wants to take control and wants to let the body be able to listen to it so we can achieve the goal, we can live a good life, have a healthy body, healthy mental health, you know, don't miss flight again, like wasting money, being able to create something organically, become a successful people rather than here and there and then wasting time. Yeah, that's the motivation, I want to be a good person, I want to improve myself.

ASSISTANT: ian, could you summarize that motivation in one or two sentences?

RATING: No (Needs Improvement) [weight=0]
BETTER RESPONSE: you have describe about healthy and success. How is success looks to you?

EXCHANGE #5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER: I want to take control of my body so I can achieve a higher goal, being disciplined people. That is the ultimate motivation.

RATING: Yes (Good) [weight=1]
FEEDBACK: good, change direction when there is no progress

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXCHANGE #6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER: Um... Well, I want to do a few minutes to manage. It's like whenever people tell me to do something, I will have a strong feeling of against. I don't know why. Like, you know, people is like this. The more you tell them not to do something, they want to do it. And for me, it's like I don't like to listen to people. Like, why should I be obedient to them, right? If it's not reasonable, why should I follow it? Like, sometimes on the street, there's like overspeed limit is too low. Then I tend to overspeed because you should drive faster. It's like stupid to do it that way. But then I think being managed is like I'm not a slave. I'm a free man. I have a free thought. I do what I like to do. I do what I feel right rather than listen to people to be their dog, you know? I just don't really like to be managed in general. Sometimes my... No, I think I'm the one in charge of myself, right? Why I should listen to someone else? I don't like that. That's that. This simple.

ASSISTANT: Ian, you've identified a strong motivation—your desire for freedom, which fuels your discipline. Now, thinking about your lack of self-control, what do you believe is the real cause?

USER: I'm not disciplined. I'm a very undisciplined people. That is the problem I want to solve.

ASSISTANT: So, you're very clear about what you are not. But let's explore your lack of self-control. What do you think is the real cause of it?

RATING: No (Needs Improvement) [weight=0]
BETTER RESPONSE: based on your defination of the disciplined people, who is the most displined people you know? could you tell about them?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXCHANGE #9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER: It could be that I really like the sense of freedom, so I don't want to give this to myself, and then I don't have self-control, maybe that is the reason, the pursuit of freedom is the root cause of lack of self-control.

ASSISTANT: Interesting. Let's move on.  Ian, you've been really clear about the outcome you want from this session. It is to gain a better understanding of why you are unable to do what you know you should do—specifically regarding your self-control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXCHANGE #11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER: I don't know. Like, what would be useful for me to talk about regarding the sleeping pattern? Why am I unable to sleep early? Actually, I know that because I don't stop early in the night. Like, why, although I know that, yeah, maybe we can talk about why, although I know I should do that, but I'm not doing that. Like, I know I need to go to the airport early, but I just keep delaying it and going very late, and sometimes missing the flight. Like, this is like quite, from many aspects, I know what I should do, but I just cannot do that. I won't behave accordingly to do that. I don't know why. That is like a curse to me. Like, bad stuff that is hard to be controlled.

ASSISTANT: Ian: So, you're discussing about your sleeping pattern and more specifically, why you are unable to change it, despite knowing what you should do. You're drawing a parallel to your ability to take action, like getting to the airport on time, and you're expressing a sense of frustration or curse regarding your lack of self-control.

ASSISTANT: So, you suspect that you might have a lack of self-control, and you'd like to understand the root cause of this behavior—specifically, why you can’t seem to do what you know you should do. You've named the issue as a lack of self-control, and you're frustrated because you feel like this pattern controls you. You want to be able to do what you desire and have proper control over your actions.

It's just I feel it's quite hard to control myself, ironically. Yeah, sounds stupid to you maybe because you're a robot and you don't understand people. But it's just hard to control. You just won't listen to yourself. You just... You may know you should do that, but the action, doing it in a totally 180 degree, or worse way. It's like you know you should be disciplined, but you just don't like to be disciplined. And you didn't make yourself disciplined and then you start to regret. Okay, that is human being.
