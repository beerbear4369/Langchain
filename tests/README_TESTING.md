# Testing the ConversationSummaryBufferMemory Implementation

This document provides instructions for testing the new memory implementation to ensure it correctly handles long conversations.

## What We've Implemented

We've enhanced the conversation system to use `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory` instead of `ConversationBufferMemory`, which:

1. Keeps recent messages (up to 3000 tokens) in full detail
2. Automatically summarizes older parts of the conversation
3. Uses GPT-4o Mini for generating high-quality summaries
4. Logs summary changes for monitoring and debugging

## Testing Process

### 1. Run the Test Script

```bash
# From the project root directory
python tests/test_conversation_memory.py
```

This will:
- Simulate a 30-message conversation
- Check the status at regular intervals (every 5 messages)
- Log all exchanges and summary updates

### 2. Analyze the Results

```bash
# From the project root directory
python tests/check_summary_logs.py
```

This will:
- Find the most recent summary log
- Analyze when summarization happened
- Show how the summary evolved

### 3. What to Look For

#### Proper Summarization
- Verify that summarization starts happening after the conversation reaches a certain length
- Check that the summary accurately captures the key points of the conversation
- Confirm that recent messages are preserved in full detail

#### Memory Management
- Confirm that the buffer length stays manageable (should be less than the max token limit)
- Verify that total messages count continues to increase even as older messages are summarized

#### Performance
- Ensure response times remain consistent even as the conversation grows longer
- Check that the system continues to function well after 30+ exchanges

## Log Files

After running the tests, you can find these log files in the `conversation_logs` directory:

1. `conversation_[timestamp].txt` - Contains the full conversation transcript
2. `summary_[timestamp].txt` - Shows how the summary evolved over time

## Troubleshooting

If summarization is not happening:
- The conversation might not be long enough to trigger summarization
- The token limit might be set too high (currently 3000)
- There might be issues with the GPT-4o Mini model access

## Next Steps

After verifying the implementation works correctly, consider:
1. Fine-tuning the max_token_limit for your specific needs
2. Adjusting the GPT-4o Mini temperature if summaries are too varied or too generic
3. Implementing additional monitoring tools for production use
