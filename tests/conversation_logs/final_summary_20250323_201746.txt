FINAL SUMMARY AND ACTION PLAN
==================================================

In the coaching session, we discussed the importance of setting boundaries to improve your wellbeing. Your goal is to reduce your weekly hours to 45 or less and have weekends free. You will track your progress by keeping a log of your hours each week and reviewing it every Sunday. Your spouse will support you by reminding you to disconnect when necessary. 

Actionable Steps:
1. Block off non-work hours in your schedule to prioritize your wellbeing.
2. Keep a log of your hours each week and review it regularly to track your progress.
3. Have regular check-ins with your spouse to ensure you are sticking to your boundaries.
4. Set reminders to disconnect and take breaks throughout the day to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Remember, your commitment to these changes is commendable, and with the right support and strategies in place, you can achieve your goal of a healthier work-life balance. Keep up the great work!
